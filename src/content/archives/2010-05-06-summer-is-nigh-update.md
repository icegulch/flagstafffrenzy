In case you forgot how the trilogy went down, here's a refresher

Almost there! The days of selfish skateboarders, arrogant lawn golfing, and filthy restrooms (washrooms for our Canadian readers) are numbered.

I have to jet early today. If you can swing it, join me at TCOM @ 11:15a.

**UPDATE:** I got pinned down by a faculty meeting, so I'm going to have to ride after 2pm. Sorry to anyone who showed up. Only a few more days of this time-jacking nonsense.
