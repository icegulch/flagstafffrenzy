      "body": "Even though they both love the Dark Lord like a brother*, Noel and DU agreed that a day of biking clear and free of SB's shadow was an unexpected relief.\n\n Noel enjoyed the civilized pace, and found that hanging back w/ DU provided a good introduction to \"micromovement,\" the latest craze to hit cycling. , whose ears still rang from his last outing w/ He Who Shall Not Be Named (\"Spin, Donkey Legs, spin!,\" \"You look like a Q-Tip in Spandex!,\" \"Allez, Allez, Allez, Lard Butt!!!\"), enjoyed the first intelligent conversation he's had over handlebars in years.
