Instead of risking getting caught in a t-bumper (thunderstorm in Pittsburgh-speak), Greg and I decided to seek out the protection of Flagstaff Mountain.

For the second time in as many weeks, Greg has posted an impressive time, riding a 30:12 from College and 14th (not the official starting line). I think that translates to somewhere around 28:00 from the official start. We'll soon see.

It's going to be warm this week, but hopefully temperatures will cool down before any record attempts. Besides, the gate is still closed at the top, making the course a little slower. Perhaps it will open tomorrow!
