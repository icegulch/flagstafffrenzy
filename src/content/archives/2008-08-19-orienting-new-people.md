In search of a motivational speech...

Today I'm attending and speaking at orientations for new French and Italian TAs, new faculty, and new Spanish and Portuguese TAs, so I won't be able to join you.

I'll bet Dave's rattling his cage over there, though, chomping at the bit to get outside. Leave a comment for him if you're up for a ride.
