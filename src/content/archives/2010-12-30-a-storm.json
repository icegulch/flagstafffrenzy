      "body": "It's true! I'm having an office-warming party, and _you're_ invited! We'll be serving pizza, ice cream, finger burritos, chicken wings, Avery's IPA, frozen vodka shots, and whatever else you feel like bringing. If I'm not here just leave it outside my door. And about those gift cards... It's fine to slip those right under the door, but please put them in an envelope first. The cleaning crew over here is damn quick. I love a good party! DU"
