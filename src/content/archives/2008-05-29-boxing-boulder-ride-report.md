Some footage from our brief stint in London

Fun ride today. I'm sweating profusely again, which means it's summer or thereabouts. Despite the heat, Rob, Dave, and I encircled our fair town. Poor Dave got a flat along the wayâ€”or perhaps he's been keeping his tire pressure even lower than the normal 15psi.

Construction has once again taken over many of Boulder County's roads, rendering the stretch on 75th between 63rd and Jay frustrating due to long wait times. Because it's one-way, there's a certain pressure that goes with being a cyclist; no one wants to be the guy who holds up the traffic waiting on the other side. Especially with [Sherrif Rosco P. Coltrane](http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2008/may/22/larimer-sheriff-singles-out-boulder-cyclists/) patrolling our streets.
