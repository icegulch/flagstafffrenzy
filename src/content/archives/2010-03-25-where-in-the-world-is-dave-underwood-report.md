##### Fun & Folly  
with CSS3!

  
Testing CSS3 gradients, rotation, and text-shadow (should look [like this](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/fun-and-folly2.jpg))

Dave's taken up residence in the UMC's "Being John Malkovic" closets on the 5th floor, so who knows if he'll even he didn't show up today...physically. I have felt as though someone's been controlling my movements, though. Hmm...

Flag was delightful. Not a soul on the mountain but moi. The roads were perfectly clear and even the sandtraps weren't all that bad.

On the topic of CSS3, WestCiv provides a great (mostly cross-browser) [gradient generator](http://www.westciv.com/tools/gradients/), and I love their recreation of the Apple navigation bar with pure CSS!
