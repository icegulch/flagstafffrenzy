Unbelievably good biking conditions [out there](http://www.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=euclid+and+broadway+boulder,+co&daddr=16th+and+baseline+rd+boulder,+co+to:1138+Flagstaff+Dr,+Boulder,+CO+80302+(Flagstaff+House+Restaurant)+%4040.003550,-105.303842&sll=40.002043,-105.290565&sspn=0.032217,0.061798&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=14) today! Dave's bike better get fixed soon...I'm getting lonely!

I had a nice slow warm-up on Baseline, made a medium pace on Flagstaff (no throat clearing or red zone moments), and even slipped the gate on the Amphitheater Road to top off a good ride.

REMEMBER: Bike Bash will be taking place tomorrow on campus, with free food, free tune-ups, and some vendor schwag:

> Come to the 2007 CU Bike Bash on Wednesday, March 14 on the Fine Arts Lawn, 10 am-3 pm.
