Inspiration: Paul Frederick's work tempts me to buy _very_ expensive toys

Sean, Greg, and I seized the day this afternoon. Conditions were ideal for a cycling sojourn. The air was dry and the sun's rays warm, but ambient coolness hid in the shadows.

Turret, iSean's snazzy new Felt Bike, has him flying uphill. Now all he has to do is eat _before_ riding.

And ascending isn't his only talent. He goes downhill FAST!

Indeed, he kept Greg company on their blistering descent. I made my way down in the prop wash. But that's fine: the views were spectacular.
