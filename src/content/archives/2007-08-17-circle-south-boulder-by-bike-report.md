Mark's friend Linda, a fan of the blog, was in town today to tag along for our ride. To give her a good sample of what we have to offer, we toured the [bike paths](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=106412931864288195098.000001131ce5a18bd8fec&om=1&ll=39.995534,-105.232887&spn=0.123355,0.32135&z=12) along Boulder and South Boulder Creeks. For once, I don't think we scared someone off!

Indeed, Linda's a Frenzy convert, ready to move here from Minnesota.

Thanks to Dave, Kevin, Matt, and Linda for the great Friday afternoon company!
