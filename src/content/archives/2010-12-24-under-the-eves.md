Two of my favorite things: New Hampshire in fall and cycling

I really like the work of Tom Guilmette, who's a total HD video geek! He does a lot of vignettes with background music, but my favorite is his [narrative account of hiking Mount Moosilauke](http://vimeo.com/1100678).

Frenz will likely be more impressed that he has survived [numerous strikes atop Fenway's Green Monster](http://www.tomguilmette.com/wp/bloopers), including a Manny Ramirez bomb.

It appears the above video was shot at Attitash Ski Area, which I remember because of its summertime [alpine slides](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV7lwdNrcQc)! But, the fall colors are the stars of this short clip.

Hope you're enjoying Christmas Eve!
