Despite these pastoral pix, Adriana said the snowline is at 7K feet! Not far from Grindelwald!

Though my better half is soaking in the fairy tale landscapes of Switzerland, she's got a lot of work to do at this "summit."

Dave and I take solace in the fact that, today, we were able to get out into the wilds, not just look at them.

And wild it was! A big dump truck hit its air brakes when I was skedaddling through the tunnel in the canyonâ€”I don't think my heart rate has ever been that high!

But, once we veered off Boulder Canyon, we were able to enjoy the tranquility of Sugarloaf and Betasso Roads. Very pleasant air and light.
