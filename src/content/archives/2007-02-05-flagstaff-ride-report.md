Luckily, I had a camera to capture Dave attacking on Matt on the climb

After getting swamped with faculty calls, I was unable to go the the screening of [Declining by Degrees](http://www.decliningbydegrees.org/), a PBS documentary about the decline of higher ed in the US. Fortunately, I own the DVD, so I can watch it tonight in time for the [DATC Junto](http://datcjunto.blogspot.com) tomorrow.

Consequently, I **was** able to get out for a ride! Dave and Matt soldiered up the hill with me.

In spite of the pools of glacial runoff and mounds of sand on the road, conditions were perfect. The temperature was actually about 10Â°F warmer up top than down on campus, but winds were blustery up high.

Tomorrow's supposed to be even warmer. Who knows?! Maybe the street sweeper will have cleaned up the sand too.
