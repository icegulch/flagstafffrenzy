Some of you will recognize [this tune](http://www.amazon.com/lovers-carvings/dp/B002CMUIPG) from the [new Kindle commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjtA62gwYkM&hd=1) (at 1:27min)

Well, it's the Friday of the first week of classes, which means madness in Arts and Sciences. I'm very much looking forward to the small sliver of time I can spend with Frenz this afternoon.

But, the long weekend is nigh, my Frenz, so fear not!! Indeed, our "near-exchange" student is visiting from Iowa (via Mexico), so we're very excited.

On Saturday, we're going to take her [full moon skiing](http://www.eldora.com/nordic.event.php) up at Eldoraâ€”and if skiing's not her cup-o-tea, we'll switch to snowshoes.

Go Pats!
