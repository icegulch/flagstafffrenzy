Matt wants everyone to know he hiked Grays and Torreys this weekend ([gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/BurtonHikesGraysAndTorreys))

I did indeed dust off the Townie today, encircling Southeast Boulder by riding the [Little Buffalo](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=106412931864288195098.000001131ce5a18bd8fec&om=1&ll=39.995534,-105.232887&spn=0.123355,0.32135&z=12) route. I rode in a clockwise direction, which was a fun change.

Always looking for a good time, I altered my route slightly by riding the dirt trail between Baseline and Marshall Road. It was just me and the creek.

Speaking of which, this is the second time in a row I've had no one to draft off. It doesn't count that I passed Kevin going to a 12:30p meeting on campus either!
