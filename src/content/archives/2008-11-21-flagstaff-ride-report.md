Another great video vignette from [Paul Frederick](http://vimeo.com/user434753)

Well, as it turned out, Dave wasn't able to join us today. Shucks. Maybe Gunther will actually hop on a bike next week, so we can get our share of Dave time.

Anyhow, I was solo today, which ended up being good, for I checked my front tire pressure while waiting and realized it was at 45psiâ€”not so good for road biking.

After getting some air, I headed up Baseline, where I espied Greg composting his knees running toward Chautauqua. I was sure to point out that it was warm enough to ride in short sleeves, but Greg answered with a flippant guffaw.

Despite the swirling crosswinds, the ride was just peachy. Not a soul at the summit; only the sound of the wind. In the distance, I could see some dark clouds enshrouding the Indian Peaks and the infamous brown cloud squatting on the Eastern Plains.

Apart from the now outlawed _Criminal Intent_, this is the most epic Frenzy lunch ride by far!

Next week is fall break, which means you can ask your respective bosses for more ride-time. You'll want to for sure, because we're aiming to ride [Super-Sugarloaf](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=1720+Pleasant+St,+Boulder,+CO+80309+(Imaging+Services)&daddr=Broadway+St+and+CO-93+to:40.023671,-105.329533+to:Fourmile+Canyon+and+Poorman+Rd+to:Crisman,+CO+to:40.037801,-105.376396+to:Escape+Route+to:Sugarloaf+Road+and+Mountain+Meadows+Rd+to:University+Ave&geocode=Fe5-YgIdaY65-SFjNV0AaBMb4Q%3BFUCYYgIdwJC5-SlLs6zhJexrhzGFnHBJ-cDGhw%3B%3BFQvaYgIdi6S4-SmHkXYra-lrhzHjhej22C2ZIw%3BFXP5YgIdGlC4-SktsAe5qelrhzF-EHFp8CFsKg%3BFantYgIddBW4-Q%3BFQ7nYgIdaha4-Q%3BFRmhYgIdYOe3-Sld6fDF7elrhzEeBhBikYVcVg%3BFfmCYgIdhIm5-Snrox4qO-xrhzHEjUuM9KjdcQ&hl=en&mra=dme&mrcr=1,2&mrsp=2&sz=13&sll=40.023145,-105.333495&sspn=0.075587,0.138874&ie=UTF8&t=p&z=13) on Tuesday.

Carve out about 2hrs around noon, boss-permitting of course. The pace will be slow, as there's a lot of dramatic, quasi-technical climbing.
