The MTB video that was here was taken down due to a copyright violation; so, here's Gray Knob again

Very nice clockwise pass at Northwest Passage today. It really is starting to feel like Fall. Sorry I missed Steve. With no one to chase, I creaked along in my own little world, adding dozens of millions of new points to Zeno's paradox. In fact, I'm not even sure if I'm back yet. - DU

SB: Those darn winds were bone-chilling this morning. I think I should've worn a full-sleeved puffy today. Oh well. At least I won't overheat on the ride home.
