How can the home of the Flagstaff Frenzy be the [brainiest citiy](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/01/the-10-brainiest-cities-p_n_790503.html#s196031) in the U.S.?

Trying to relax todayâ€”I've only done about two hours of work. Watched some Weeds and some football, napped, and jogged.

I need to get up to the mountains and see some snow. Speaking of which, I saw a fun [article on Yahoo Answers](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101122080911AAB8fK9) about the conditions needed for snow. Hint: temperatures do not have to be below 32F.

Looks like another decent week of weather for cycling. Hopefully the last week of classes won't be too hectic for y'all.
