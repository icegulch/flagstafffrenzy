Steve post-wisdom teeth removal. I was told I'd look like Brad Pitt afterwards. I want my money back!

Well, Dave wasn't bitten by a spider today. Turns out it's a little more serious. We Frenz wish him well!

While I spent the afternoon napping and Burton spent it reading _Seventeen_, Kevin rode Sunshine Canyon and Greg rode Fourmile Canyon. Their reports are filed in the comments.
