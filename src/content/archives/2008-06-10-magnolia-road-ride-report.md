Hmm...coming down into my price range

Wow! Now that's a climb.

Dave and I braved 86°F temps, traffic, and tunnels on today's adventure. Oh, did I mention 20% plus slopes?!!

Yup, Magnolia is a killer. But, the rewards are spectacular. I think it's got some of the best terrain and views of our lunchtime forays. I'll definitely head back up sometime this summer, perhaps as part of a big loop on the Peak-to-Peak.

Anyhow, Dave hit the creek on the way down. Needed to bring his core temperature back down to 104°F. You okay, Underwood?

Wonder how the Frisbee Frenz outing went? Report, anyone?
