It's Cyber Monday! Let's try not to trample Dave againâ€”virtual rug burns are as bad as real ones

Ignoring my very own instructions to gather at 12:10p, I sprung out the HUMN door at 12:07p thinking I was late for the pre-ride rendezvous. I'm losing it, what can I say?

I knew Kevin had been hamstrung by meetings, and I thought Dave was AWOL, so I just took off. Sorry, guys.

So, I spun up the _Linden Lariat_ solo on what amounted to a grand late November day. Temps were in the upper 40s and winds were non-existent, which is rare at this time of year.

On the way down, I recognized the hunter-orange vest of my cycling pal Dave, as well as his companion-in-arms Brett. Feeling like a fool for not following my instructions to meet them at 12:10p, I accompanied them up to the saddle on Bow Mountain.

They soldiered on up the dirt (perhaps riding _Roubaix Row_ at the top?), while I saddled up and returned to campus.

All things considered, it was a great ride. Sorry for ditzing it, fellas!
