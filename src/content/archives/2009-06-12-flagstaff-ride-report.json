      "body": "The brain is all yours while you travel, Bro'. You'll likely need it to read roadmaps, order fast food, and negotiate bribes in Pennsylvania. While you're away, Ronna can open my beers for me and we just got the new Reader's Digest in the mail, so I'm good. Speaking of dumbed-down entertainment, thank god for baby-boomers in denial. I had several rough-and-tumble sorties on the way up the hill today, way more than the usual none. Nothing like walloping pot-bellied AARPsters in neon team jerseys to make me feel young again. And vice versa. Have a wonderful and safe trip, Stevie! And don't worry about checking in on the Frenzy while you travel. You know you can trust me. DU"
