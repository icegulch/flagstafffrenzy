      "body": "My left knee continues its downward spiral toward surgery number six. No running for me today. I will be doing Flag on the bike, though, if anyone wants to join in. Just let me know. Last Friday some Bertram caught up w/ SB and me in 4Mile remarked on the racket our bikes were making. Said he could hear the squeaking and chain-chatter from three curves back. Guess it might be time for a new chain and a tune-up. Unlike Elliot Spitzer, I intend to use my upcoming check from the fedrul guv'ment to stimulate the bicycle economy. It won't be soon enough."
