Though I'm a self-described dope, my latest invention has grabbed some people's attention

Like moths to a flame, Dave and I decided to ride a route that would take us past Boulder Creek. Bunch of rubberneckers we are!

Still, the ensuing ride up Sunshine was great. The road still looks nice and clean.

###### Flash Flood Warning on the Boulder Creek Path!

**11:03a**: I just received a reverse 911 call on my office phone that there is a _Flash Flood Warning_ for Boulder Creek this afternoon. The [water does seem quite high](http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/modules/mod_floodcam/viewcamera_large.htm).

Consequently, the Boulder Creek Path is closed today.

From the looks of the video above, it sounds like the [problem upstream](http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=140609&provider=top&catid=188) could be severe. It is somewhere in the vicinity of the Red Lion Restaurant.

We've quickly removed all the priceless art from HQ, but if I worked down at the CC, I'd probably move my car from the lot...just in case.

I'm guessing we won't be riding Fourmile, Poorman, Betasso, or Magnolia today.
