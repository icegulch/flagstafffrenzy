Nothing like steady noodling up Fourmile Canyon on a warm March day. Because the grades are gentle, the pedaling is too. There's still a touch of corn-ice on Fourmile Creek and absolutely no green in the woods to speak of apart from the parched ponderosa needles. Still, it was nice to reach Wallstreet, chuckle at the news kiosk in "downtown", quaff some gatorade mixed with water, listen to the wind chimes and the creek, and then coast down. Hardly had to use my brakes either, as the wind was out of the southeast. Just a nice day!
