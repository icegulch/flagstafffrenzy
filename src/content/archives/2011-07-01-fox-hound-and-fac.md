Don't forget to participate in the after-work festivities

So, as mentioned previously, our FAC begins at 6pm @ The Hungry Toad.

Before that, however, I will leave a trail for any interested hounds to follow. I'll start marking my route [from dojo4](http://bit.ly/ler2sx), let's say at the intersection of 17th and Spruce.

Hounds can gather wherever on campus (talk amongst yourselves) and leave right at 5pm.

This fox/hound will be pretty casual and thus won't stray far from the Toad vicinity. A real effort will be made to keep the trash talk lo-brow and distasteful.
