The Frenzy will not siphon off last night's "State of the Union" (courtesy of Werner)

My mom wrote last night asking if Dave was going to take over regular posting duties in the coming weeks. I'm happy to say that will never happen.

Nay, the Frenzy needs an unstable despot, not someone who'll try to lend credibility to its gatherings or flourishes to its prose!

\[_Applause_\]

Rest assured, my Frenz, posts will continue to ooze out of the same cesspool whence they've always come, and lunchtime rides will continue to serve as rocky, barren places whereupon no seeds of intelligence will find purchase!
