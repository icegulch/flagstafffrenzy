Man, we keep hitting it just right on our rides! The clouds moved overhead, providing shade and relief from the mugginess.

Rob and Greg joined me on Flagstaff Mountain today, but poor Greg had to patch a flat again before even getting out of the gate. Still, he's the fastest patcher in the West, so we ran into him along the way.

Looks like some nice t-storms are hovering about. Hope one opens a can on us!
