News Flash: neither Dave nor Steve won "best dressed" at the Oscars last night

The red carpet was rolled out for Dave and me (and some deer) on Flagstaff today. Absolutely nothing to complain about weather-wise or otherwise.

Dave says the spring bug has caught him, and he's now counting the days. I'm still good with winter, but these spring previews aren't unappreciated.

###### THE FRENZY TURNS 3: FRIDAY SOIRÃ‰E

Since no one wanted to freeze in a small nylon tent this past weekend, we've decided on a more civil way to celebrate [three years of the Flagstaff Frenzy](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2005/02). Come join us for suds somewhere on Pearl; we'll leave Humanities around 5p.
