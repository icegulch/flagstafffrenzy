Kimberly found this _ergonomic_ keyboard for pirates; it is [International Talk Like a Pirate Day](http://www.talklikeapirate.com/) after all

While I couldn't make the Pirate festival over in the Stadium today, I did block off time to ride. I had to block off time, in fact, because Friday is "All Faculty Call Steve Day" (unofficially, of course).

With Dave's help, I slipped out the side door, disguised as a janitor. Then, we hopped on our steeds and rode off into the sunset. Good ride. Still comfortable temps; no sun; and good company!
