Sean thinks ITS should have a fleet of [these](http://i.gizmodo.com/5167137/this-is-the-worlds-most-advanced-bike-and-it-has-an-on%20board-computer). Would they be OK locked to a bike rack in the snow all winter?

I have a 1pm presentation, so I need to prepare for that. I hope to get out and take advantage of the extra sunlight this evening. Back in the saddle tomorrow!
