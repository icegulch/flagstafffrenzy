A quick, windswept ride today. I tried to rendezvous with Dave at the Gregory Canyon bridge, but he must have been swept by an altogether different vortex.

I only made it to Panorama Point, where there was a Tibetan ceremony taking place. Kinda cool, but there was a lot of traffic as a consequence.

Have a great weekend!
