White sands and palm trees: uncommon Frenzy sights

It was about 80Â° warmer in Sarasota than in Boulder, but we were here with you in spirit! We're proud of you for carrying the torch while we toiled on the white sandy beaches of West Florida.

As our [special edition gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/icegulch14/SarasotaPostHolidaysVisit) reveals, we did indeed keep the legs spinning during our sojourn. It was hard to get used to flat roads, palm trees, and white sands, though. As nice as it was to wear shorts and a short-sleeve on the bike again, I still prefer Boulder, frigid air and all.

Thanks to the army of frenzy poets whose sharp minds and tongues kept things real!
