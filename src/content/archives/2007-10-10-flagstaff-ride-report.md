Dave narrates his life in Alaska

Dave regaled us with more tales from the _Far North_ on today's ride up Flagstaff, like the time he lost a paddle on the lake and had to swim in 33Â°F water for 2.5 miles. That guy's tough, I tell ya.

Adriana clung to our wheels like glue, claiming she was giving it all she had (but she was smiling the whole time). Or was that a grimace?

Dave's auditioning chumps who can put up a fight on two wheels. Takers? Dennis? \[No offense.\]
