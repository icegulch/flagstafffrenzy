Long time, no post! Sorry, guys and gals.

Had a fantastic surprise birthday pizza party last Friday. I was reminded how great my Frenz are, and so I wanted to say to all of you (even those who couldn't make it) THANK YOU, especially my darling dearest!

This is my last full week in town before going on a maple syrup run...I mean, going to my sister's wedding back home. Anyhow, I have new sidewalk chalk for fox/hound. I'm just sayin'.

Syrup requests?
