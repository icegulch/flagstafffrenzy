Dave did a bang up job of lampooning our fearless leader last week @ his retirment!

A slight tailwind hurried Greg, Steve and I up Fourmile to Salina today. It was just enough of a breeze, though, to place the apparent wind at zero mph... not the best situation for those of us who overheat just thinking about exercise (me).

Since Steve's bike is in the shop getting new batteries, he borrowed Adriana's wisp of a carbon fiber weapon and proceeded to trounce the field (again, me).

I hope he uses the Townie next time.
