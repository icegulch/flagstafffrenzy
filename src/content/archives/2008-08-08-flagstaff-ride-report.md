Kevin called not long before lunch to let me know his 1p meeting was cancelled. He suggested we ride Flagstaff, so I said "Sure!"â€”we aim to please here at Frenzy HQ.

Kevin was kind to me today, for I had failed to eat this morning, save for a couple cups of coffee and a chocolate-chip muffin with sugar on top...a recipe for bonking if there ever was one!

I managed not to bonk, and Kevin didn't try to talk me into riding Super-Flag either. Just as well, as we both would've gotten our butts kicked by [Tyler Hamilton](http://www.rockracing.com/team/rider.php?sname=thamilton) (wearing Rock Racing's old [red kit](http://pelotonjim.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/rr.jpg)), who cruised by us no problem. Probably one of his easy days.

Bon weekend, all!
