This is the last time I put Zeiler in charge of the birthday cake

It's DU's birthday today, and we're celebrating by ditching him. How callous?! We tried to talk him into an extended ride, but for some reason he wanted to relax and have fun.

If you're the nostalgic type, you might consider casting your eyes to photos of our [2009 Surprise Party](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/DaveSBirthday) or our [2006 Blizzard Run on Sanitas](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/DaveS55thBirthdaySanitasDuathlon). Good times.

Anyhow, we wish you a very Happy Birthday, Big D! And [Zetroc's own](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/deardave/thank-god-youre-a-country-girl) Lisa and Steve [do too](http://sendables.jibjab.com/view/ArYL5NBTf4bsNIWF)!
