      "body": "4Mile is a bit of a stretch for my newly-engineered kick bike. I'll do some hill work afoot today. I talked to a welder, though, and it sounds like there's hope for the Wheeler. Taking it in for a checkup later this week. You'd think a $20 bike would have a longer life span, wouldn't you? Sheesh."

What a great trail... all of the ground cover is greening up, the wild plum is blooming, and Gregory Creek is groovin' away. Gotta' love spring!"
