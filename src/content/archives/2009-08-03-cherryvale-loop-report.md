With Dave out of town, things fell apart. Kevin, aka. Powerful, went for a ride around the Cherryvale Loop at 11:45a. I would've joined him, but I was in a meeting until 12:05p.

So, instead I called iSean and asked if he wanted to do the same route Kevin did. He said "Sure" and we went on our merry way.

It was a little cooler than before because clouds were starting to build, and we even had a few raindrops refresh us on the latter part of the ride. So, all in all, a great day!

Sorry we missed you, Powerful!
