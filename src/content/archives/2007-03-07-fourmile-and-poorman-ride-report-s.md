The popular new riding skirt  
(made famous by Dave)

Conditions allowed us to go up Fourmile Canyon and down Boulder Canyon, though Kevin and I were nearly saw-dusted off the road by a logging truck, and Greg was rabbit-punched by a nasty pocket of semi air.

Dave was submarined once again by mechanicals today, but seeing Greg in a non-stationary saddle made up for the Frenzy Elder's absence.

Given this weather, I'd say we're all back in business now, so expect some fox/hound next week (after we spring ahead). Stay tuned!!

Unbeknownst to us, Adriana was waiting for us on Poorman Loop, as her own ride report reveals:

> Oh poor man...you just got your butt kicked by a gal in a black mini-skirt.
> 
> And where were the rest of the Frenzy gaggle? Seems they were taking a gander, mosying their way up Boulder Canyon and Fourmile.
> 
> Meanwhile, the few males that dared attempt Poorman on this gorgeous spring-like day, in fact, resorted to merely coast down the steep dirt track. The ascent was simply too overwhelming, and they felt overcome before they'd even begun.
> 
> And so, the bomb in the black mini-skirt soloed the precipitous route, enjoying stunning views of the still snow-tipped foothills.
> 
> The most Poorman could offer in challenge were a few pitiful splashes of mud, nothing that a little water couldn't wash from a black mini-skirt.
