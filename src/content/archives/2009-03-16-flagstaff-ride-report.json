      "body": "Maybe he should go back to that old Ford Explorer of his. He really had the touch when he parallel parked that beast. It seemed big, but its boxiness and high center of gravity made it possible for Dave to \"thread the needle\" on many occasion. I'll never forget the time he burst through the gate in lot 310 and slid right in next to Dennis' Volvo and Ken's old Tundra slowing down from 15 mph! I helped him buff out the skid marks on Dennis' bumper strips; and Ken never even noticed the ding on his door. A little Turtle Wax does wonders."

      "body": "Mark's right about the Explorer; with that beast I had a deft touch on the helm. For some reason the little Kia Ratpellet I'm driving in the video neither [gees nor haws](http://www.iscowp.org/Ox%20Power/Lesson%202%20%20Gee%20and%20Haw%20by%20Balabhadra.htm) when I tell it to. Stoopid car has a mind of its own. This is what I hate about surveillance cameras, by the way. I still remember the day I was standing in line at the Pig 'n Jug, waiting to buy a replacement O-ring for my Uroclub. I looked up and saw the back of this dude's head in the surveillance monitor and thought, \"That poor bastard has a bald spot the size of a salmon platter.\" But when I reached for my wallet, so did he. Bummer. JG and I looked for El Bailey today on Flag, saw only traces. DU"
