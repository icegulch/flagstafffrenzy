Smoke has a choke-hold not only on Boulder but even as far away as The Great White North

The California fires have rendered our skies smoky and unhealthy. The moon was a deep, burnt orange last night, which made me glad I was nowhere near Gammon...he's from the underworld.

Anyhow, Dave cajoled me out of my oxygen-rich den here at Frenzy HQ and accompanied me up Flag. We're having our lungs x-rayed later. We'll keep you posted on the results.
