Winds are annoying here, but on Mt. Washington they make walls bow inward (120mph)

Despite the gusty winds, we had a lovely ride up Flagstaff today. Actually, windy days are often the clearest, in terms of air quality, so our lungs are the pinker for it.

What made the day even better was stumbling upon the Asian Food Festival on Norlin Quad as we made our re-entry on campus. The three of us were reminded of how great it is to work here and have such good colleagues.
