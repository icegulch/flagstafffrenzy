Steve's handed me the keys to the site. Let's hope I don't drive it off a cliff

Greg, Rob and I had a nice ride up Poorman today. Matt would have come along but a foot issue relegated him to the pool. The sun hid behind the clouds for most of the ride, so it was a little cool at times. The scenery was great, though, as all the rain has made everything lush and green in the canyons. And aside from a few washboardy sections, Poorman Road was in good shape.
