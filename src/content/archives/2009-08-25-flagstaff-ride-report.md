One of my favorite shows on TV

Once again the usual suspects, Rob, Dave, and I, headed out in questionable conditions to test our legs in Boulder's Foothills. It was a welcome respite from the hustle-and-bustle of campus.

Today was a drencher, for the humidity was high. Fortunately, however, despite the ominous skies, we stayed high and dry (from rain).

I pinpointed the noise on my bike recentlyâ€”actually, a mechanic at _Full Cycle_ did but who's keeping track? Anyhow, my seatpost is what's making a racket, preventing me from sneaking up on Dave and pulling the old banana peel trick.

Beware, Underwood! I will soon have a new seatpost.
