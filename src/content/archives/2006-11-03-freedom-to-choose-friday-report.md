Steve (seated) betrays Frenzy faithful; runs with Rob (standing) for Â£20,000

I feel dirty now. On top of it all, it was 66° outside, which is about my cutoff for running. I'll need to change this week's poll if this weather sticks around for a while. Thanks to Rob and Brian for leading me to the dark side. My apologies to Kevin for going Benedict Arnold on you.
