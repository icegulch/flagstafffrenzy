Someone needs to show this to [Matt Burton](https://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/ColoradoTrailRide#5395279337521090018)

Good to ride Flag yesterday with Tom and Noel. Tom had some interesting stories about meeting John Dean at the National Archives recently.

Fun seeing some Garmin guys flying uphill too.

May have to do a short jaunt today, but I hope to see you guys out there!
