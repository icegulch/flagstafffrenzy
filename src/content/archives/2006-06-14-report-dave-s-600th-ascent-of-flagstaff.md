Dave makes it 600! ([gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/DaveS600thFlagstaffRide))

Thanks to everyone for participating in today's momentous ride, especially our surprise refreshments goddess, Kristen!!! Congratulations to Dave for making it to **#600**, to Tom for making it to **#1**, and to everyone else who's somewhere in-between!

Dave still claims he likes the "new" bike, but he still despises the heat...100Â°F today!! If you'd like to relive the climb from the comfort of your air-conditioned office, [check out the gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/DaveS600thFlagstaffRide). Otherwise, see you again soon in the hills!
