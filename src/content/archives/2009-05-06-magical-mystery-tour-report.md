Greg and I hung around Humanities for ten minutes or so, but SB never materialized. We called his office, tried his home phone, even paged the Active Seniors Department over at WalMart, but no dice. Too bad, because he missed a great counter-clockwise Poorman. Four Mile Creek is trying hard to be a river, the pastures in the saddle above Sunshine are greening up, and there's the smell of warm pine and wild plum in the air. The only thing missing was the inaugural bee sting. Great ride, Greg! Sorry we missed you, Steve! DU
