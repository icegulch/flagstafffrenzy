The Frenzy Expedition successfully discovered the _Northwest Passage_

We've found a ride that rivals Poorman. Actually, Northwest Passage makes Poorman look rather impoverishedâ€”a poor imitation as it were.

Thanks to Dave, Kevin, and Matt for participating in the dangerous scouting mission. Bad news for them: I think I've found yet another, even more [secretive route](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/FrenzyFunnies#5395895732657370386)!
