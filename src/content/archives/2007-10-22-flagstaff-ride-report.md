As though he were part of a NASA launch, Dave blasted up Flagstaff Mountain, setting a blistering pace from the junction of Broadway and Euclid to the first parking lot. There will be a lot of crossed-out stick figures in his riding log on this day.

Great riding weather these days if you can make it out....
