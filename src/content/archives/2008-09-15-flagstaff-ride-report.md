Big crew out there today. Dave, Greg, Rob, and I were all present and accounted for, climbing Flagstaff's ramparts under bluebird skies and warm temps. Greg and Dave enjoyed some drive-by plum picking even! A Frenzy first for sure.

###### Frenzy Cleanup Part Deux!

Don't forget, tomorrow is the second installment of our Sunshine Canyon Drive cleanup. Gather at Bald Mountain Parking Lot at 8am or at Southside Walnut Cafe at 7am. Hope you can make it and don't forget your work gloves!
