      "body": "The rest of the Frenz missed another beautiful ride up Flagstaff today. The temperature took a marked and welcomed dip just above Flagstaff House all the way to the flag pole. A cool breeze and temperatures in the high 70s made it a great day to ride. Without anybody to chase, or be chased by, I took my sweet time and reached the summit a mere 38:05 after leaving Euclid & Broadway."
