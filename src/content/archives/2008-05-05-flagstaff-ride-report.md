I don't think anyone was waiting at Telecom today but if you were, my sincere apologies. I didn't get out of my meeting as early as I would've liked (12:20p), and ended up hitting the road just after 12:30p.

In any event, great ride up Flagstaff. It's still not too hot to be annoying—the breeze has that subtle crispness that makes springtime so nice. The Amphitheater Road is indeed open, but it doesn't seem anyone knows it yet (or everyone's going to the tippy top of Flagstaff Road).

Speaking of which, Adriana, her friend Pam, and I did SuperFlag yesterday, and it's still as hard as I remember. I rode below 140bpm until the hairpin, then it was 180s the rest of the way as usual.

Tomorrow we need to do some recon on Sunshine Canyon. More on that later…
