Sean was in the _Colorado Daily_ yesterday. No one knows what he was plotting.

I take the above caption back. Dave knows what he was plotting.

Earlier this week, my former Mount Washington Observatory colleagues emailed with some sad news: [the 231mph record has fallen](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_wind_record_toppled;_ylt=Ak1T.t.rVYymwhHFH7XSJk9saMYA). It was bound to happen.

Once again, I can't ride today. It's been about a week. Sorry. Dave's raring to go, though. Coordinate with him.

Do they have one of those protective, chicken-wire cages there, Dave?
