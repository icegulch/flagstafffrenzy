      "body": "Okay, here's a thought... A year or so ago I had a notion that folks from ITS might want to adopt Flagstaff Road, as in the Adopt-a-Highway Program. I put a little blurb in the Digital Cookie Jar, Dennis Maloney was the only guy who responded, and - being the zero gravity kind of person I am - I forgot all about it. But, ta-da!, here's another shot at it! Anyone interested? It looks really easy: http://www.dot.state.co.us/AdoptAHighway/ And the good publicity couldn't hurt, eh? Let me know; I'll happily be the point man. ...And one more thing. Would someone PLEASE PLEASE drop Steve Bailey Friday? (God knows I've tried.) -Dave Underwood"
