Had I known, I would've tried to visit last week

Heading down University into a noticeable headwind, I decided to forgo the planned Fourmile ride in favor of the less traffic-prone Sunshine Canyon climb.

Well worth it too. The Indian Peaks are still coated with snow and stand in stark contrast to the cobalt blue sky.

But my motives for riding Sunshine went beyond a desire for nice scenery. I wanted to see if the "Adopt-A-Road" sign marking the upper end of our territory was in place. It is! I didn't have a camera, though, so no pix.

Dave and Kacey Jones have invited me to tag along for a Jamestown ride to the Merc tomorrow. K-No's outta town for a week or so, but anyone else wishing to join should present themselves at the Greenbriar Inn at 8am sharp.

Happy Weekend!
