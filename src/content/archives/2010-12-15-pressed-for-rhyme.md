There's a print shop [right beneath our noses](http://chronicle.com/blogs/postcards/a-letterpress-shop-survives-printing-poems-in-the-era-of-youtube/654)

I remember when my aunt was a typesetter out of her house. She used to have the wooden racks of type sitting out when I would visit.

And I remember at the University of Minnesota taking a type-setting class. In that class we used a markup language to tell the printer how to set the type.

Perhaps the Frenz should consider a hostile takeover of Naropa so that we can do a print-based version of the Frenzy each day.
