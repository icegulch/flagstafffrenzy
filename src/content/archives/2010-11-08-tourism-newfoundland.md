Dave, Bret, and I were just talking about the [Land with a Half-Hour Headstart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_Standard_Time_Zone)

I know, I should work for Tourism Canada, eh?

Hopefully those of you visiting this terrible time-sink with IE7+ will be happier now. Since IE6 doesn't support PNG graphics without extra scripts, I don't think I'm going to let it in. Sorry.

Dennis had a great question: how do I offer a rebuttal to the Dear Dave screeds? The answer: you can't. Yeah, unfair, I know. We have our reasons, though.

First, Dave's opinion does not come cheap, so we just can't afford second opinions. Secondly, what's the point of an Advice column if everyone chimes in. As Dave always says, "Sorry, you're just not smart enough." And lastly, you're probably wrong.
