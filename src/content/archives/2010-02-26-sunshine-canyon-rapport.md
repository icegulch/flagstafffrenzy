Sunshine was a little less welcoming than I had anticipated, with slush-ice stretches along its umbral underbelly. This did little to spoil our fun.

Indeed, we chit-chatted about this-n-that, including our weekend plans. Dave's headed up to Walden for some x-c skiing, while we're going all the way to Tahoe for our [nordic fix](http://www.royalgorge.com/). The weather in the High Sierra seems to be [favorable](http://bit.ly/4E0Rx2).

Enjoy the full moon and last weekend before March!
