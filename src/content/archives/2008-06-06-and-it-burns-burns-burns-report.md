Yeehaw! Now that's a ride!!

The [Ring of Fire](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=colorado+and+folsom&daddr=lee+hill+dr+%26+lefthand+canyon+dr+to:lefthand+canyon+dr+%26+olde+stage+rd+to:olde+stage+rd+and+lee+hill+dr+to:Folsom+St+%26+Colorado+Ave,+Boulder,+CO+80302&mra=pi&mrcr=3&sll=40.050245,-105.30776&sspn=0.157947,0.355682&ie=UTF8&t=p&z=12) certainly delivered on its promise, though today "Whirlwind of Fire" might have been a more apt moniker.

Dave and I spent a long day in the saddle. Only minor traffic to deal with and a few other cyclists to boot.

We really enjoyed the descent down Lefthand. I almost overcooked a turn near the Lee Hill/Lefthand junction, but I recovered in time. Then, Dave and I found ourselves embraced by an F5 tornado at the top of Old Stage. Yikes. I guess they'd call that the effects of [orographic lift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orographic_lift#Leeward_winds).

Anyhow, great time. Happy weekend, all!
