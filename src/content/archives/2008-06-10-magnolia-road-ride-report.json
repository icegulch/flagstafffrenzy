      "body": "Say what? You'll have to speak up; I have water in my ears. After scrappin' our way up and down the Big Mag, the creek was my first choice on the menu. The water's still cold enough to inhibit normal breathing, but damn, it felt good! The last time I rode Magnolia, I was with [Jeannie Longo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannie_Longo). Okay, okay... not _with her_ exactly, but in the same race, the [Mike Horgan Hillclimb](http://www.boulderracing.com/horgan.asp). She was a little ways out in front of me (5 miles, +/-) for most (all, really) of the race. Afterwards, we laughed over drinks (she on the jet back to Paris, me in my boxers on the back porch) and reminisced (passed out, actually, in my case). Oh, the memories..."

      "body": "Doris, Mike, and I went to the course near Broadway and Greenbriar by the South Boulder rec center. The course wasn't too crowded. Mike was the master, lofting drives up to the tee mostly. He definitely broke par. Doris and I were more the \"duffers\" of the outing. Doris tried various frisbees, some designed for disc golf, and others for general use. She experimented with various throws: how much to snap the wrist, how much of a lead to give yourself, at what height to let go... I struggled with my new driver which slices left dramatically (not unlike my regular golf drives). The wind was quite gusty, which made the course more challenging. A good time was had by all and we hope to get more people out sometime in the future. Perhaps the cycling frenz can play a version of polo by combining mountain bikes with frisbees."
