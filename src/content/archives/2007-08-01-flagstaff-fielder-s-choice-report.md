Like the French, the Frenz enjoy a good taunt

Though Dave is not _technically_ supposed to ride, run, or blow his nose, he joined me for today's [Fielder's Choice](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/choice.gif). I chose to run Gregory Canyon while he biked Flag.

I made it to the top of Flagstaff, but I can't say the same for Dave, who did an about face. I blow my nose at you, silly Englishman!
