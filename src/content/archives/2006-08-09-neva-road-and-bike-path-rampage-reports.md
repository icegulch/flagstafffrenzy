Map of our Rampage route

###### PART I: Neva Road

Against their better judgement, Matt and Steve rode Neva Loop today, knowing full-well they'd pay for it later. Apparently, Dave and Dennis were just ahead of us:

> Travelogue, date August 8th, time 12:11ish. Participants, Dave "hammerhead" Underwood, and, Dennis "I'm still back here trying to hang on" Maloney. Hot ride but lots of fun.

> So, where was everyone else???

###### PART II: Bike Path Rampage

Great ride with nine folks total! You wouldn't believe how good Old Chicago pizza and beer tastes after such a long ride. Thanks for coming, all!!!
