      "body": "We had a nice stroll today. We met up with Brian, Dave, and Matt before their climb up Flagstaff. There was some talk of having them draft behind us, but Dave thought better of the idea. It took about 50 minutes. The temperature was perfect. We saw flowers and blooming trees along the bike path. I pointed out to LeCarla and Jill (my fellow Fleet-Feet-ers) where Dave takes a dip in the creek after his rides. On a number of occasions I had to step out of the way for bikers overtaking us. We saw Ken Iwamasa out on the lawn across from the Armory, enjoying a nice peaceful moment while perched up against a rock. We also spotted a dead gold fish in Varsity Pond... I think MCDB is out playing with the pond's acid levels again. -- Mark."
