Avoiding snow plows and dump trucks is a good idea on road bikes

Finally!!! All roads leading to Flagstaff were dry: 16th, Baseline, and Flagstaff.

Though ridable, the route was rendered more challenging by the winds and sand. The winds imposed themselves on the ascent, and the sand made its presence felt on the descent. Still, by averaging 5mph on the way up and down, I was able to manage the objective dangers.

Speaking of which, how was lunch with Matt and this girl? Sounds like everyone was there to coach Mr. Burton.
