Great showing on Neva Loop aujourd'hui! Kevin even deigned to join Matt, Rob, and I. Greg, what gives?! Fuller? Kent?

Burton dropped off early, claiming he _just_ wanted to spin today. We're all well-acquainted with MB's tricks by now, though, so we knew he'd let us go a ways ahead, then try to reel us in. Another Walter Mitty in our ranks!

Speaking of surreal stories, I'm dying to find out how Floyd will respond to Lemond's testimony yesterday. He and Basso (and the rest of them) should confess!
