      "body": "I always wonder how many more times I'll see old Leon sitting on his rock at the top of Anemone. He was there today, huddled up in a blue parka, facing west, and utterly motionless. I've seen him up there for almost twenty years, no matter what the weather. He was old when I started running the pipecut, he must be ninety now. I never talk to though; I learned my lesson a long time ago. Old Leon is one bitter dude. Now, sometimes when I see him, I wonder if I should poke him to see if he's dead... But no, I don't want to get him started again. Once every twenty years is enough."
