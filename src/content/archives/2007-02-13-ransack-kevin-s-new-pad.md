Now that he's moving, Kevin's going to have to shop more at [IKEA](http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/)

Today's a special day for K-No; he's moving from the hinterlands of Fort Collins to Boulderâ€”or more accurately, Boulder's bastard brother, Gunbarrel. Let's go toiletpaper his new pad. Meet at 12p at Gate 5.

###### Ride Cancelled!
