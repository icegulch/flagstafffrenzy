      "body": "Mamils? This has happened to me before: I realize that the avocation/hobby/sport I deeply love has been discovered/adopted by Bob, the fatuous wretch who lives down the street. Cycling, which I got into thirty years ago? It's Bob's favorite now, and, as he stretches in his driveway, shameless in God's sight, after a long (six mile) ride, he lectures me on \"fast-twitch training drills,\" and \"feathering the gears on The Morgul.\" Back-country skiing? Bob's been there, done that; _The bowls below Notchtop were a little cruddy this season, didn't you think?_ Flyfishing? Ditto. I've thrown Bob off, though. Rather than pursue a restraining order against his next half-assed intrigue (\"Sorry, but no Stratocaster for you, Mr. Smith. We have a directive from the court...), I've tossed him a red herring: \"What's in the box, Dave? Looks heavy.\" \"Oh nothing, Bob. Just the latest cool thing. I can't wait to get started using it.\" \"Well, what the hell is it?\" \"Nothing, really Bob. _Men's Health_ says it will revolutionize masculine _chic_ in America, but, really, it's nothing. Excuse me, but I have to get it down to the basement where it'll stay cool.\" \"Really?! Where can I get one? Does it come in carbon fiber? Are there accessories? _What the hell is it?!_\" Really, it's _nothing_. ;) DU"
