Just as the TGV broke records last week, so we sped up Flagstaff at a dizzying pace today

Though it was blustery everywhere else, it was calm and quite nice on Flagstaff today. Thanks to Katie, Adriana, and Dave for joining the earlier than normal sojourn.

Dave and I still cut it a bit close for a 1pm meeting, but no one seemed to mind that we showed up clad in spandex. I suppose it's a sign that we've successfully lowered others' sartorial expectations of us.
