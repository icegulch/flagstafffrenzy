Well, I got out of my Excel/CULearn grading presentation sooner than I thought (but it went really well!), so I called Dave and suggested Flag, due to Dave's time constraints.

Though I'm hesitant to reinforce my already damned reputation as a whiner, I have to say: it's getting a little too hot all of a sudden. Let's keep it in the 40-50s for a while. Whaddya say?

Good to get out with Dave, tho!
