Frenz exercised their democratic rights today, vetoing the proposed Poorman Loop ride in favor of a flat, easterly one.

It was a great day for anyone riding in a southeasterly direction, as the winds were steady out of the northwest at 10-20mph. So, even though we technically rode on the flats today, they sure felt like hills in the headwind.

**NEWS FLASH:** Rob's proposed an after work [Initiation](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/initiation_view.jpg) run next Wednesday. Those interested should contact him. Sounds like fun to me.
