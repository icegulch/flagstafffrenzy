Our name is now in lights...well, you get the metaphor!

Our sign is up! During the ride today, Noel, Dave, and I got to see first hand our name etched in Boulder history. Now we just have to do an actual clean up. I'm thinking clean-up session, followed by brunch. How's that sound, boys?

Great weather out there today. Dave says if it never got hotter than today, life would be perfect. Unfortunately, he hasn't seen the forecast for this weekend. Sigh.
