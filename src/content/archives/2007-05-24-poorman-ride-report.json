      "body": "Think I found the workout that'll get me through the next 3 months. Bike to Settler's Park, then run the Anemone pipecut up to what I've always called Poorman Hill. Then walk back down to the bike. It's a relatively safe bike ride to Settler's and the pipe cut is super steep... easy on the knees and very aeobic. It's hell being an arthritic bleeder. All I need now is one more malady to make it really challenging... Sheesh. If someone wants to join me sometime, Poorman Hill _is_ really nice."

The weather was so severe in KS that we didn't want to camp or even find a motel, so we did the smart thing and tried to outrun the storm. Keep sweatin'! PS: I had looked for that SNL clip before...nice work finding it, Kev. You're hired!"
