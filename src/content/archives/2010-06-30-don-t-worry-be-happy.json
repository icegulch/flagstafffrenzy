      "body": "Hey, Matt. Dave had quintuple bypass surgery recently. He went in for a stress test because of the ongoing \"vapor lock\" episodes he was having, and they found his arteries were 90% blocked (which of course made him brag that he's been riding at 10% of his real capacity, and will thus kick our butts when he recovers). Anyhow, they signed him up for bypass surgery the following day, and he's doing well now. But, it'll be a while before he can ride again. Looks like we'll be doing Frenzy walks for a while. Hope all's well with you! When will you be in town? Soon, as I recall.... -Steve"
