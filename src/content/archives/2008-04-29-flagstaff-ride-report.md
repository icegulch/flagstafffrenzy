Kevin found a new gym over in Gunbarrel

Today was almost a carbon-copy of yesterday in terms of cloud cover, but the temps were much nicer (almost too warm, with the Mesa Lab reporting 67Â°F). A little wind out of the South, but nothing to whine about.

It was somewhat of a sad day, as I think today was my last ride before they open the gate on the Amphitheater Road. It usually opens May 1st. From now on, we'll have to contend with traffic and goofers all the way up to the tippy top.

Tomorrow, I have a 12-1p meeting, so I probably won't get out until after that. If you want to wait, let me know. If you want to go somewhere at noon and want company, leave a comment with the details.
