Ride on, Matt! The Frenz wish you all the best. \[[View Gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/MattSLastRide)\]

Though it's sad to see Matt go, it was great to send him off with the cheerful camaraderie we've come to expect from the Frenz. Enjoy the hijinks through our [photo gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/MattSLastRide).

Thanks to everyone for showing up, to Dave for the cooler, and to R L for driving all the way from Denver to run support!

**Good luck, Matt!** We'll see you in December.

###### This Morning's Post

> Since first joining our midday marauds in February 2006, MB has steadily plugged away, raising his fitness level from ho-hum to catch-me-if-you-can. Indeed, not long after hitching his wagon to the Frenzy train, our flyboy [aimed higher and higher](http://flagstafffrenzy.org/2006/06/matt-burtons-napa-valley-ride-report), eventually winning the prestigious _Most Improved Rider_ and [Best Dressed Rider of 2007](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TJUjU-_DxP4I7oqlDdT9_g?feat=directlink) trophies. But now, Frenzy Faithful, Matt's moving on. Let's send him off right with a farewell ride up Flagstaff. Gather at Telecom at 12p.
