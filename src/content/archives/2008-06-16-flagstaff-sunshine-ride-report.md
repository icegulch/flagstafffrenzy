Word on the street is "The Guthernator" rode with Dave today. Good going, Jennifer! When are you going to join us?

So, Koster and I hit Sunshine today, determined to keep our heart rates below 175bpm. No such luck. Oh well. Great ride just the same. Koster reminded me that I'm a slow descender. Where were you, Greg?

After a weekend of 7-8% relative humidity readings, today's 60% was muggyâ€”though my family back east remind me that that's nothin'! At least I only needed one water bottle.
