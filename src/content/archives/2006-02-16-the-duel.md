Yup, that time of the week again: The Flagstaff Duel. This week, however, I think the roads won't be good enough to bike. So, why don't all runners meet in front of Telecom at noon. For those who want to wend their way up to the trailhead on their own, you can meet us there at 12:15p. Hope you can make it...it's fantastic running or walking in the snow!
