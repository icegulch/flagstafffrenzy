Since he can't ride up, Dave decided to bomb down

Just as well, [Kev](http://flagstafffrenzy.blogspot.com/2008/07/flagstaff-independence-ride.html#c276404294646719666), my meeting with a faculty member ran over (30min), so I didn't get out until 12:30p. Sorry to anyone who may have been waiting for me at 12:10p.

But, as you can imagine, it was a fantastic day to be out. It's a little more humid and hazy than normal, but not unbearable by any stretch. The 73Â° temps are a welcome respite from the 90s!!

Happy Fourth, All!!
