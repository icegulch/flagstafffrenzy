Just when Dave thought he'd found a peaceful moment, the Albuquerque Balloon Club showed up

Glorious day to be on two wheels! Dave and I found the going easy, as winter loosened its grip on Boulder Canyon, leaving the roads relatively dirt- and obstruction-free.

Fourmile Creek was beginning to roar its muddied-water roar. Dave didn't dare dive in, which means it's still **really, really** cold. Polar bear cold.

Reminds me of the time Adriana and I [crossed that river in Alaska](http://picasaweb.google.com/icegulch14/DenaliNationalPark#5402252883639291090). Painful!
