      "body": "Great outing w/ SB today. At first it was a bit annoying dealing w/ the field crew from AARP magazine. They wanted good shots of the Birthday Boy riding bikes w/ his friends. They kept leaning out of their mini-van with those big zoom lenses, trying to get an \"action shot\" of SB. (No luck, really; they'll have to use the motion blur in Photoshop to give the pix any sort of credibility.) They kept crowding our little peloton, and I thought someone was going to get hurt. It all turned out fine, though, and after three laps around the park, we all headed over to Village Inn for their Blended Sizzler's. Thank God for the big-print menus! SB almost ordered \"chew food\" by mistake. Could've been a long afternoon! Anyhoo, a good time was had by all, and Steve is back in his \"office\" (we call it that to make him feel useful) resting quietly. Happy B-Day, old fella!"
