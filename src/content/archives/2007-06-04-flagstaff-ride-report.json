      "body": "I went out and did a fleet feet walk today. I tried to catch Tim C., but he wasn't in his office. I did the ATLAS-Stadium-Creek Path-Arboretum walk in about 40 minutes. There was a bit of light rain, but not even enough to stain the walking path. I capped off the walk with a [Berry Lime Sublime smoothie](http://www.nutritiondata.com/facts-C00001-01c22ML.html), possibly restoring any calories burned by the walk. :-) -- Mark."

      "body": "Weird thing happened this weekend. Evidently someone - vandals? Boulder county open-space employees? - decided to make the Poorman pipecut even steeper. They must've somehow figured out how to tilt the whole mountain several degrees to the east. The pipecut is damn near straight up now. I didn't see any physical evidence of the operation, no fresh boulder fields, no massive raw earth scars or newly-felled timber, but my quads and lungs told me the hill has definitely been tweaked, and they never lie... do they? Sheesh; I hate it when people mess with things."
