Put up your dukes...it's time for Boxing Boulder

With Kevin, Adriana, and Matt joining me, we had a great peloton to slice through the thick, humid air on Boxing Boulder today.

It was good to get out and practice echelons and other aerodynamic formations for Sunday's [Buffalo Bicycle Classic](http://www.buffalobicycleclassic.com/). If you haven't signed up for it, do so pronto! Space is quite limited now.
