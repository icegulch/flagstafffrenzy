Hey, that looks like Dave's pink Wheeler bike, but that's not Dave!

The weather's getting nicer, hinting ever so slightly that spring is coming. Dave and I rode up, while Rob blasted up on the trails. Here's the data:

> So, the run up Flag is about 1735' from atlas, for a total of 3.06 miles to the summit. Returning via panorama point makes for a R/T of 6.28 mi, 1879' total elevation gain.

Again, thanks for that, Rob. At some point, I'll put these maps in our [Routes](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/routes) section.

Anyone want to coordinate [Bike to Work Day](http://view.exacttarget.com/?ffcb10-fe75157075640d7d7514-fdea1076706d0d7e70147572-fef91672746d0c) this year? I'll be gone at a conference....
