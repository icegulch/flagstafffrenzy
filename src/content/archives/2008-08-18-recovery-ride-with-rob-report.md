Adriana, Espresso, Baxter, and I hiked up Signal Mountain to see snow from this mid-August snowstorm!

After seeing the giant welt on Rob's leg and hearing about the 20Â°F temps, I'm thinking this [Pikes Peak Ascent](http://www.pikespeakmarathon.org/) might be a rollicking good time.

Greg, Rob, and I spun up to the Amphitheater and tippy-top to take in views of snow-coated peaks today. Impressive snow cover for August, if I do say so myself.

I had the fireplace going on Friday and Saturday nights. I'm ready for cold weather, I think.
