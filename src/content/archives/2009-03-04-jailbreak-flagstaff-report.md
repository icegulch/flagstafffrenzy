What can you do when both the rider and the bike are fast?!  
Speaking of speed, who will be [the one](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/comments.jpg) to post #1000??

Great riding today! Our numbers swelled to capacity, nearly shutting down Frenzy HQ for an hour. We should've paid attention to the [warning signs](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/churchsign.jpg).

To wit, Blistering Brian, Killer K-No, Gonzo Greg, Dynamo Dave, Rocket Rob, Speedy Sean, and Sh\*thead Steve all gathered at Humanities to enjoy the 70Â° temps and good company. Thanks, guys!

Sean proposed fox/hound on Friday. Anyone game?
