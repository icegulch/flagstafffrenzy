These are Deb's old stomping grounds (Dartmouth Outing Club)

It's really exciting to watch dark, billowing clouds enshroud the [Indian Peaks](http://mms.nps.gov/romo/netcam.jpg) from the top of Flagstaff Mountain, especially when the winds are whipping by. Unfortunately, that cauldron of snow won't reach us today.

Flagstaff was nicer today than on Mondayâ€”only patches of ice and much warmer temperatures. Dave and I watched several riders whiz by us on the descent, but we weren't in a rush to get back.

Can you believe _The Replacement_ is only 22 years old?! Geez, makes Burton look like a grizzled old man!
