Some pix from our Bow Mountain sojourn

Despite the low turnout and high winds, Frenz bravely climbed Bow Mountain via Linden Drive today. While Adriana and I only made it to the col, Dave forged onward, aiming his front wheel at the twisting summit and his camera at the dwarfed landscape below. There's now a [photo gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/BowMountainRide02) of Dave's solo exploits.

For those of you who play fantasy football in one of my leagues, you'll be happy to note that the [2007 schedule](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/schedule) has been released. Some good match-ups right from week one!
