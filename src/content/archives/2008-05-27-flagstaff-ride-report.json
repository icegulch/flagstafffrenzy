      "body": "Afraid I'm going to _have to_ take the day off again due to a nasty lingering cold. I actually skipped the Bolder Boulder because of it. Bummer! But thanks to a hand-me-down from LeCarla, Olivia rode a bike for the first time over the weekend. She loved tooling around the neighborhood on her training wheels and I can't wait 'til she can join the Frenz on a ride. Don't worry Dave, it will be a few years until she's breathing down your neck. It was also great to hear her utter a universal biker's complaint: my butt hurts. It was a very proud moment for this dad. -Greg"

It always strikes me as ironic that the trails are mostly deserted on the prettiest days. A little rain or snow or sub-zero weather inevitably weeds out the bulk of the \"outdoor enthusiasts,\" and leaves us diehards with plenty of elbow room. I'm not complaining."
