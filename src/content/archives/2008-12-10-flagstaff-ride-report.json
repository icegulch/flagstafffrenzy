      "body": "I wore 5 layers yesterday on Flag, which means I have 5 layers of bike clothes that are still completely soaked. I could ride in my office togs, but these are my favorite double-pleated Bobby Jones gaberdines and my Foligliano calfskin shoes don't sit well on the pedals. Footwork for J and me today. I'm gonna' hang all my stuff out the window [George Bellows-style](http://www.artchive.com/artchive/b/bellows/cliff_dwellers.jpg) this morning and maybe it'll be dry and minty-fresh by tomorrow. It'll class the place up a bit, too. DU"
