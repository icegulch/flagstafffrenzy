Unfortunately most of our trash talking has been confined to baseball this week. Once again, my meeting schedule will prevent my trash talking from the seat of a bike today. But it's Friday and Flagstaff beckons. If you're up to the call, be at Telecom at noon. Riders, please send a report my way for the blog.
