Dave suggested I bring the truck out today, because Tim was coming and we were going to do a "slow ride."

Should've known better.

Dave sat behind the truck on the flats, then tried to drop me on the climbs, being nice and rested from hanging out in the vortex behind my crate.

Of course, I would've done the same. Rapscallion!
