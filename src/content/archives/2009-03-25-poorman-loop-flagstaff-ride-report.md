I heard Rambo 4 was a lot like this, but probably not in French and not as campy

It must be spring break, for all the worker-bee Frenz were out today. Not surprisingly, Dave lay low.

Noel, Kevin, Melissa, Adriana and I took a pass on Poorman in order to stay sheltered from the wind on Flagstaff. It was still quite breezy up there, though.

To my surprise, Kevin informed me that there's a major storm on the way (well, "major" for this "winter" anyhow). Let's hope for a doozie!
