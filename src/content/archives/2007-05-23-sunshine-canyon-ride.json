A 1:00 p.m. meeting at the Computer Center and some sore [sesamoids](http://www.footphysicians.com/footankleinfo/Sesamoid_Injuries.htm) will keep me off the bike today. Tomorrow looks good though. Enjoy the ride!"

Alas, it was a lonely, cloudy ride up and down the canyon, as I didn't see anyone on a bike, let alone any of the frenzy faithful. I did see and hear quite a few hummingbirds, which was nice. On my way back to campus along the creek path my ride was interrupted by a bird crashing into me. It was really more of a glancing blow, and the bird and I recovered without incident and continued on our respective ways."
