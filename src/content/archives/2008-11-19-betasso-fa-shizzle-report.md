I may encounter a similar scene at home today; our own little puppy Baxter _loves_ toilet paper

Great day again! Thanks to Rob and Dave for keeping me company. Guess what, Dave? I'm pulling an Underwood right now: bought a Mountain Dew.

Anyhow, I have to admit, as much as I like the cold, nasty weather, I'm digging this prolonged summer. Of course, that said, there was a hint of Greeley in the air, which can only mean one thing.

I'm wondering how bad this freezing drizzle will be. On [Mount Washington](http://mountwashington.org), freezing drizzle ([FZDZ](http://www.pilotpedia.com/wiki/index.php/METAR/TAF_Abbreviations)) was bad news. It meant the constant de-iceing of instruments with a crowbar.

Hopefully for us, it will just mean carrying a few extra clothes.
