So we didn't actually _ride_ Super-Flag...who's counting?! Adriana's back got the best of her, Jason battled a burrito, iSean struggled with "the cold," and I tarried with food-bonk.

Despite all that, it was an excellent Friday turnout with impeccable weather, even if iSean would've liked another 10Â°F. Okay, now to go get some food.

Bon weekend!
