Mark just informed me of this...

Great day today, except for the sweltering heat.

Rob, Matt, and I rode Flagstaff at a "heat-reasonable" pace, staying hydrated and keeping the streams of sweat off our browsâ€”not always successfully, though.

Looks like a fun Tour de France lineup this weekend through next Wednesday. Enjoy and have a great weekend!

###### UPDATE: 3:10p

Would someone mind [carrying a shoebox](http://www.velonews.com/tour2007/news/articles/12851.0.html) for me on next week's ride?
