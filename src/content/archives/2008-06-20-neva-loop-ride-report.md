It's true: Kevin's still working for CU-Boulder...or at least living nearby. He joined "us" today for a great spin on Neva Loop ("us" being me). Long time, no see, K-No!

It was kinda breezy the whole way, so chit-chatting was tough. 63rd was strangely busy with traffic, but instead of taking the Diagonal back, we followed 63rd to Valmont, which was less busy and thus more enjoyable.

So, Kev, when's the next screening of [Dexter, Season 2](http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/home.do) happening? Happy weekend, all!

###### Bike to Work Day: Next Wednesday, June 25

Don't forget. Next Wednesday is _Bike to Work Day_, and our good fox/hound friend Dave Cavalieri has organized an ITS team. So, [sign up now](http://www.drcog.org/btwd2008/dsp_registerIndividual.cfm) and be sure to join the "University of Colorado at Boulder - ITS team".
