YouTube turns 5 today.

We had a re-awakening today on Super-Flag. I realized that I was grossly out of shape, and Dave realized once again that Super-Flag is very steep. It's always good to jog the memory.

It was the first borderline "hot" day too (67F), which reminded us that it's hard to wipe sweat from your brow when you're out of the saddle on a 15% slope in your granny gears. Still, it was great to dry almost instantly on the descent and not feel cold as a result.
