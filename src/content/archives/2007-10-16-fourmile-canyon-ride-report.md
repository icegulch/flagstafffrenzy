Boulder Canyon was breezy but pleasant today, and Fourmile Canyon featured a few tailwinds, so it was fun too.

Dave's still down for the count, so the Frenz have been flying solo for the past few days. Not to worry, though.

A newbie has requested Neva Road tomorrow, and Dave's rear wheel won't be in arrears, so plan on a flat, fast ride.
