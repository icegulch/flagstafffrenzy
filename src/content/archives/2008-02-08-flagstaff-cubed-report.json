      "body": "Sorry SB, I got held up by a customer. A very nice person, but a talker indeed. By the time she left, it was already 11:30. I saw the ceremony also, but I didn't know they were Tibetens. With all the little flags and such, I assumed they were Shriners. I was afraid I might run over one of their little go-karts and ding a fez or two. Will someone help me learn to tell the difference, for future reference?"
