Dave was as limber as an earthworm today, though he does have some severe raspberries on his right shoulder from last week's mishap, which only adds to his Easy Rider appeal.

Adriana caved into Frenzy pressure and rode with us, taking the heavier, clumsier Trek mountain bike but still spinning like a champ.

The weather was alluring, with light fog and dry roads. Beautiful day!
