Mount Washington is caked in rime these days; nice undercast in the background

The [Mount Washington Observatory](http://www.mountwashington.org/) has posted some really nice photos of the [mamma fox](http://www.mountwashington.org/photos/journal/2008/12/2237.jpg) and [baby fox](http://www.mountwashington.org/photos/journal/2008/12/2224.jpg) family that somehow survives up there.

These past two days of bitter cold have reminded me of my time up on "The Rockpile." When your sinuses actually freeze, it's pretty cold out.

The rumors are true too. Dave did ride yesterday. He's using today as a "recovery day" but I don't think he's fatigued.
