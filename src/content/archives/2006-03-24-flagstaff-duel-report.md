Reflecting on the words of the great Ben Franklin:

> You must not, when you have gained a victory, use any triumphing or insulting expression, nor show too much pleasure; but endeavor to console your adversary, and make him less dissatisfied with himself by every kind and civil expression that may be.

Today it was great to be out-of-doors in the warm, spring air with good friends. The runners ran _hard_, and the bikers pedaled _fast_. Heart rates and spirits were lifted, as we all suffered through what Dave calls "the drama of climbing." I have a great job and even better colleagues! Thanks for coming.

Have a great weekend or vacation, all!!
