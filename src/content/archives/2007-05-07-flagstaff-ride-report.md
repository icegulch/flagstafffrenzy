Great ride today with Dave and Matt. Mr. Burton's foot didn't bother him as much, but he's taking his recovery slowly, as he should.

Sounds like there's more drama with respect to _Operacion Puerto_ in Europe. My brother pointed out [Ivan Basso's confession](http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2007/may07/may07news3) and I draw your attention to the recent news about [Alejandro Valverde](http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2007/may07/may07news)!
