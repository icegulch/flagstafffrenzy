What a pleasant surprise.

Just as I was about to write the ride off, my wife and iSean asked if I would join them on a little Flagstaff foray. It was fantastic!

The purple lilacs are as fragrant as they will be, the meadows are as green as they get, and the yellow flowers at Chautauqua are quite brilliant.

Don't forget: good deals on running shoes @ this weekend's Boulder Running Company sale. I'll be on the lookout for mocassin flats for the track.
