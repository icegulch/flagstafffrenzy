A beautiful summer day in upstate New Hampshire. The historic Randolph Hotel is seen just to the left of Oakmont Island. In the background, the Presidential Range marches majestically toward Canada.

I stumbled across the official state song of New Hampshire the other day, thought I'd share.

> **Old New Hampshire**
> 
> Gather Ye your slickers
> And step out in the rain
> And rail Ye toward the Heavens
> And take His name in vain.
> 
> For yea, Ye Granite Staters, 
> It's pouring once again,
> And has been without cessation
> Since Mom got out of the pen.
> 
> Yea, it's springtime in New Hampshire,
> When our hopes swirl down the drain,
> And on Grandma's north side,
> There's a coat of moss again.
> 
> But fret Ye not, my Homeys,
> For depression we're not wont,
> Remember it could be much worse...
> We could all live in Vermont.

No me today... hoofin' later this afternoon, but sequestered in a meeting over the lunch hour. Call iSean if you'd like to chase him up Flagstaff.
