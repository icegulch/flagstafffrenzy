Just over a week left

Looks like we just got a taste of snow yesterday with a brief respite today. Tomorrow, we're supposed to get 1-3".

In its wake, yesterday's squall left some [really picturesque landscapes](http://www.nps.gov/webcams-romo/glacier_basin.jpg), but the roads are still enticingly dry. What great riding weather!

Dave is close to publishing a serial for our "renowned" _Arts and Culture_ section. It's a mystery complete with its own cover and graphic inserts (of course!). Stay tuned.

If any of you gentle readers would like to publish an essay, short story, poem, or "choose your own adventure," let us know. We're always short on content but chock-full of pomp and circumstance.
