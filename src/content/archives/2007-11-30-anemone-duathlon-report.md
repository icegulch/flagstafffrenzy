Well, we weren't able to run through thigh-deep snow, but Dave and I still had fun pedaling over to Settler's Park, running around the Red Rock fins, and then scrambling up to the top of Anemone Hill.

The telescoping grades of the "trails" are a real bear; in fact, it feels a lot like time-trialling on a bike, as there are no resting points. Man, some of those trails require the use of all four paws.

Here's hoping we get a big blizzard this weekend! But, at the same time, here's hoping Greg's parents are able to make it here safely!!
