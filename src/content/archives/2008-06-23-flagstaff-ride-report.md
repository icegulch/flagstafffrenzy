I had to bail last minute on the Flagstaff ride. How was it, Greg?

Instead of spinning up switchbacks, I spun home to meet the chimney sweep who was trying to keep birds from flying in my houseâ€”they've been swooping down the chimney like Tom Cruise.

I did manage to sneak in a little run on South Fork of the Shanahan with Espresso, tho. Of course, later, when I returned home, there was a bird in my chimney again, despite the new screen.
