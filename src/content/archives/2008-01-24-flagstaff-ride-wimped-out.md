I bailed once again today. This has to stop. Rob's asked if we could do an flat, slow ride along Boxing Boulder or something tomorrow. Hope y'all can join me.

###### Challenge to the Frenz from Werner

> Hey fellow Flaggstaff Frenzy Frenz, if you are up for a little "Fleet Feet"¬ù Mall walk on Saturday morning, here's a way to do that and to give money to a good cause. On Saturday (January 26th) the Muscular Dystrophy Association is holding its annual Stride and Ride event at [Colorado Mills Mall](http://www.coloradomillsmall.com). The Stride and Ride gives people with MD the chance to ride their wheelchairs alongside other supporters who walk through the Mall to raise money for the [Muscular Dystrophy Association](http://www.mdausa.org/). Please join Mark, Nancy, and Angela Werner as we stride to raise money for MDA. You can register for the event at 8:00 a.m. at the mall at [14500 W. Colfax Avenue](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=14500+W+Colfax+Ave,+Golden,+CO+80401,+USA&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=0) in Lakewood. Park in Area 4 near Eddie Bauer and Jillian's. We hope to see you there!
