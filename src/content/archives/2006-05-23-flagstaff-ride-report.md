Well, with winds on the plains of 24mph, gusting to 35mph, we bagged Neva Road today. And thank goodness! It was actually windy on our alternate route, Flagstaff, which is a rarity, as it's pretty well protected--but not from winds out of the southeast. Anyhow, we were treated to a great battle between the Daves, as well as a super-strong ride from the ever-improving Mr. Burton, who will soon be dropping all of us, as he has youth on his side. Anyhow, lots of fun coming down, and picture-perfect weather and temps. **Don't miss tomorrow's ride!!!**
