      "body": "Amazing fall colors, gentlemen! I would gladly trade a month of wonderful Florida Fall weather for a nice Indian Summer day on the trail in Colorado. The recent temperature drop here from \"hellish\" to \"bearable\" has made riding much more attractive in the past couple of weeks. It's still does not compare in any way, shape, or form to the riding back home in Colorado. I truly miss the regular \"humblings\" I received on both trail and asphalt from the more seasoned Frenz."
