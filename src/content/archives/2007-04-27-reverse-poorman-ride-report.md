Exquisite day to be out and about. At Dave's suggestion, we threw a wrench in the works by riding Poorman Loop in reverse. It's amazing how riding something in the opposite direction opens up new vistas.

Greg pipped me at our sprint line once again today, so I'm just going to start calling him [The Lion King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Cipollini) and bowing when I see him.

Thanks to Dave and Greg for the great ride! Have a good weekend, everyone!
