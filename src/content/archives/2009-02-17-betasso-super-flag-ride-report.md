Came across [this great story](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/02/22/travel/escapes/20080222_MARTIN_FEATURE.html) yesterday while researching audio slideware. The use of tech is exemplary.  
And since my dad re-builds Martin guitars—we visited the factory in PA once—I found the story compelling too

Too bad Dave lost _The Battle of Leaky Knee_ today. Excellent weather for a jaunt up Super-Flag, and Greg and Rob were great stadium pals. Though the sandtraps were out in full force, there were nearly clear pathways through them.

Hope everything's sealed up, Davey!
