Adriana's climate conference might be overshadowed ("smoked out") these next two weeks

Fun ride! Made it up to the Amphitheater Parking Lot faster than expected, so I decided to prolong the suffering by going up Super-Flag too.

I was going easy, actually, so there was no suffering to speak of. Dave "Motown Man" Underwood is back in the ranks tomorrow! Bet he'll bring us gifts in the form of D-town bullet casings.

###### Earlier Today...

Dropped my sweetie off for her flight to L.A. in the pre-dawn hours. The forecast for Pasadena—the conference is taking place @ CalTech—is "smoke" unfortunately. Sounds like the [Station Fire](http://tinyurl.com/nut9yv) is a real threat.
