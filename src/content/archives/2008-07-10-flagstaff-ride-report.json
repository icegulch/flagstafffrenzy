      "body": "Oh yeah, I forgot one more thing; there was a golf ball on a fairly steep incline. It was a Wilson. If I remember correctly, I think Mike Matthies hits Wilsons. I bet he teed that one up on the roof of Telecom. I'd say it went ten miles at least on the first bounce. We'll have to call him \"Extreme John Daly.\" -- Mark."

      "body": "I think finding the University of Illinois \"diploma\" -- actually just a certificate of appreciation from the Illini regents -- was a cool find. Coming across the scene of a car crash and all the debris was weird. But I have to agree that all the cigarette butts, although not a surprise, were very disappointing with all the wild fires we've had over the last few years. -Greg"
