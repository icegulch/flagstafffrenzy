The "Emotional" Spell-Check (courtesy of Noah)

Lots of submissions today, including a handy tool submitted by Dr. Werner: the [sick day excuse generator](http://www.getodd.com/raz/sickday/sickday.html).

In fact, I used the above tool today, and my excuse for not being at work: "The voices told me to clean all the guns today."

Sounds like Dave is going to do shopping at lunch. And this from the guy who refuses to bowl on rainy days. Sheesh.

Thanks for all the submissions, Frenz! Have a great weekend.
