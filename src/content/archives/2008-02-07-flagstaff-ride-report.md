No sign of Dave's bum knee as we headed up Flagstaff today. There was, however, a rather pesky wind that stalked us at every corner, despite our offerings of frankincense and myrrh.

Still, thanks to the 8x8' bed of "The Truck", we were able to pack our down bags and [ECWs](http://tiger.gsfc.nasa.gov/ecw.html), thus staying nice and toasty on the descent.

Speaking of the South Pole, my friend Randy "Crunch" Noring just had a feature named after him down there. Randy's spent some 14-15 years on the Ice, so he deserves it. The new feature is named [Noring Terrace](http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=136231).
