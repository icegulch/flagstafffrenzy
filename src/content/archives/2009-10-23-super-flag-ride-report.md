Dr. Gammon found this great gift for me! How considerate of him.

The skies nowadays are either snowy or crystal-clear. Today we had the latter.

  
Steve and Greg ride Super-Flagstaff on a brisk October day

The ride up was quite toasty. Later we realized it was due to a tailwind that lifted us uphill.

On the way down, we realized there was actually a strong, shrill, armor-piercing breeze that left Greg numb. Greg braved the conditions in shorts, summer gloves, and a long-sleeve jersey.

Wonder if he's thawed out? Thanks for joining today, Greg!
