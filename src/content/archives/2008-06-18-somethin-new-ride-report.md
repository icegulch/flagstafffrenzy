Tycho is a great [deejay](http://tychomusic.com/), but he's also a talented [graphic designer](http://blog.iso50.com/)!

Fun spin out to Eldorado Springs this afternoon. Dave, Rob, and I agree the bike path is not an ideal way to open up the throttle, but once you're out on Marshall Road you can glide. Thanks, guys!

I'm out tomorrow, but I'll post a ride for anyone who wants to organize. Dave's out too.
