Some ghoulish characters showed up for today's ride! \[[gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/SecondAnnualFreakyFrenzy)\]

Ah, another cool day for Halloween! It didn't stop the Frenz from celebrating, though.

Indeed, Dave, Rob, Sean, Adriana, and I sashayed our way to the top of our favorite climbâ€”Sean with a **single speed** setup! At the summit, we enjoyed treats and trash-talk.

Thanks to Mark and Jill for representing the "Frenzy Fleetfeet" and to K-No for showing up to take a picture (he still worked out at the Rec Center). Deb, aka Velma, said she will join us next year.
