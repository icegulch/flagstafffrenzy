My fear is that the true nature of his \"surgery\" is not so much about restoring his normal function as it is about giving him super-human powers along the lines of Steve Austin. Afraid my days of edging out the old guy could be numbered.\n\nBTW, hope you didn't [come across any bears](http://www.dailycamera.com/archivesearch/ci_13099379) on your ride up Sugarloaf.\n\n -Greg"
