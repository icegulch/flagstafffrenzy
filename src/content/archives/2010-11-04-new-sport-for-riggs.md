Tim Riggs's birthday is Friday. Think I've found a new sport for him.

Qu√©bec City is one of my favorite cities in North America. If you get the chance to [visit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMDaU4L61lI), don't hesitate. They have a wild _Carnaval_ that includes ice sculptures, a parade of lights, and an [insane canoe race](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iwdaXwIpxI&hd=1) across the mostly frozen St. Lawrence.

Speaking of cold, it seems we may be flirting with one of the [latest first snows](http://www.dailycamera.com/news/ci_16424044) on record (Nov 22). Looks like our [August predictions](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/pollsarchive?poll_page=2) were a tad off. There's a chance of snow next week, but it's too early to know for sure.

Meantime, we're getting sensational riding weather! On Flagstaff yesterday, Dave and I made our first-of-the-season dash around the gate. Yup, the road is all ours again until May 1.
