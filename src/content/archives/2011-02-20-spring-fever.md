The voice of the North Woods, the White-Throated Sparrow, heard on [last year's hike](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAhWyy7A0ls&hd=1)

We really haven't had much of a winter, but even so I'm suddenly awash with nostalgia for summer in the _North Woods_. Maybe it's all the planning for my sister's upcoming wedding.

Anyone else found their mind wandering toward the warm breezes of summer?

I have tomorrow off, so if anyone is up for riding, I'll be sure to post something around the usual lunch hour. Otherwise, I intend on being more active this week. Hope to see you!
