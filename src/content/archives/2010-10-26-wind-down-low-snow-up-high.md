Just up the road at Eldora, it's snowing hard

Those gauzy clouds outside that never seem to move mean it's windy in the foothills, snowing in the high country.

Indeed, the instruments at NREL's [National Wind Technology Center](http://www.nrel.gov/midc/nwtc_m2/display/) recorded a peak gust of 76mph around 4am this morning. Adriana couldn't sleep as a result. Looks like the [webcam atop Duane Physics](http://icons.wunderground.com/webcamramdisk/n/i/nickersonm/1/current.jpg) has been blown sideways!
