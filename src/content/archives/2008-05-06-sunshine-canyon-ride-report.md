Getting excited for trail runs that start with headlamps?

Dave was disappointed Greg didn't show; he's since filed a missing persons report.

Much to his delight, though, Dr. Lenski made a grand appearance today. Welcome back, Noel. Of course, poor guy chose to join us on the dizzying ramparts of Sunshine Canyon. He did very well, just the same!

The recon mission was a success. I'm putting in an application with Boulder County to adopt Sunshine Canyon Drive from [mile marker 2.5-4.5](http://tinyurl.com/5g4s8j) (Poorman Road Junction to Bald Mountain Park). Hope you can lend a hand! Details forthcomingâ€¦
