I have great Frenz! Thanks for joining today, everyone.

Noel, Kevin, Greg, Adriana, Dave, Mark, and I gave something back to the hills we love this morning. Some of the interesting tidbits we found: car bumper, remains of car wreck, retirement diploma from U. of Illinois, and much more.

The most boggling thing was the cigarettes. Come on, people! We found lots of other interesting things too. What was the most interesting find in your minds, guys?
