Oops...I've been slackin' lately as concerns posting rides _before_ we actually ride. My apologies. Thanks to heads-up play by Mr. Burton and Mr. Underwood, a ride was arranged for Valmont Reservoir. In spite of the lenticular clouds which suggested high winds aloft, we were able to do this ride out east in great conditions: sun, temps in the 50s, and only gentle winds. Tomorrow promises more of the same. Perhaps it's time we hit Sunshine....
