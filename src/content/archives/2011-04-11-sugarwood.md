Back home, it's sugaring season. Yum!

It's high time we do a morning ride, followed by a big stack of pancakes and maple syrup! Who's in?

We may have to open up some of the fair weather rides soon: Back Alley, Northwest Passage, Poorman, and of course Flagnolia. And we've never made it to Gold Hill!

Anyone else hear the thunder snow Saturday night? Don't see that everyday.
