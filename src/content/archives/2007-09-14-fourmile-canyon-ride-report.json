      "body": "I have to defend the last crumbling remnants of my honor... I discovered 4 minutes before noon that I was flatted. No spare tube, either. Being a deeply superstitious person, I took it as a sign to stay off the bike today. My backup plan always involves walking down to Robb's and attempting to drown out the high school kids in the electric guitar showroom. I would have done better against Burton... Lost out big time to some little snot w/ a Strat and a Marshall the size of a dumptruck. Failure dogs me."
