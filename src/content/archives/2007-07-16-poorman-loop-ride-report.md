Steve and Adriana are all smiles now after riding Trail 401 in CB this weekend

Wow! [Poorman Loop](http://www.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&doflg=ptm&ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=100713211184899290190.000477add2cc711144261&ll=40.022093,-105.30653&spn=0.083738,0.136471&t=p&z=13) was hot today.

Poor Greg had a front tire flat only half a mile from campus, so he had to walk back shortly after saddling up. The Frenz recent front tire woes are getting a little disconcerting.

In spite of the heat, Matt rode like the burley-man he is. I'm telling you, he's improving and will soon be beating us all...and letting us know he's beating us.

Hope Dave can find [Dick Proenneke's cabin](http://www.nps.gov/lacl/historyculture/proennekes-cabin.htm) while playing with the mosquitoes in Alaska.
