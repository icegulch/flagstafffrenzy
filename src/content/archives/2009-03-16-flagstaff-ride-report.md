Wish Dave would learn how to park that new car of his...

Actually, there was almost no wind outside today. Great conditions!

Unfortunately, I did not check the temperature ahead of time and overdressed. Part of the reason I wore my pants and wool shirt, though, was due to the fact that I forgot to wash my jersey and shorts this weekend.

I took my laundry home [to prepare](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/churchsign.jpg).
