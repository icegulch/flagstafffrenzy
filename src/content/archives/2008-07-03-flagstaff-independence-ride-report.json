      "body": "Only Greg would say that... He's he only guy I know w/ cobwebs on his brake levers. He's not reckless; he's simply conserving his brakes for future generations. \"And these were my great-grandpa's brake pads!\" \"Cool! It doesn't look like he ever used 'em! Can I hold them?\" PS, I see my surgeon next Wednesday. (She's doing a demo at Home Depot, so I won't have to drive all the way back down to the Aurora VoTech again. Nice.) I'm assuming she'll tell me it's okay to resume biking. And I'm assuming she's building a conservative cushion into her timeline, because I'm assuming she's assuming I'm too obtuse to grasp the idea of gradual, managed recovery and healing... So look for me back on wheels Monday. Can hardly wait!"
