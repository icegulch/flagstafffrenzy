A few pix from our Colorado Trail ride this past weekend ([gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/BurtonRidesTheColoradoTrail))

So, turns out Adriana was alone on Flagstaff yesterday, carrying the torch for us slackers. Apparently Greg and Matt rode later, so kudos to you guys!

Dave went down to the creek and swam against the current. Strangely, he reported that while swimming, he brushed against a computer that had been jettisoned in the creek! Dave, did it have a Media Services serial number on it?
