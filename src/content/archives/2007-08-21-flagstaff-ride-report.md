Though there's new pavement on our Flagstaff Mountain route, the road gradient hasn't changed. I'll have to see if Frenzy HQ can address that problem.

In spite of the craziness of the first student move-in day, we managed to herd a good group of folks: Dave (oops...not supposed to say that), Matt, Kevin, Greg, and I. This is the kind of crew I'd follow up Mt Evans! Nudge, nudge, wink, wink...
