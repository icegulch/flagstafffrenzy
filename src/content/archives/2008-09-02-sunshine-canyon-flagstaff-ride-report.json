      "body": "\"Hello, this is Frenzy Headquarters. How may we help you?\" \"Yes, I'm calling about your ad: _Learn to Trash Talk While You Sleep._ I'd like to order the tapes.\" \"You're talking about the tapes produced by our CEO and spiritual kingpin Steve Bailey?\" \"That sounds right... The ones that promise to turn you into a shard-spitting monster in just two weeks.\" \"Great. We can have those shipped to you by the end of the month.\" \"Oh jeez, I can't wait that long! I'm getting beat up something fierce out here. I need those tapes yesterday!\" \"You sound like a motivated buyer. We could overnight them, but it's pricey.\" \"Money's no object; I'm flush, believe me. I just need to get armed and soon. I can't even defend myself against a senior citizen at this point. I want an acid tongue and a styrofoam conscience like Mr. Bailey. His stuff makes your brain pucker.\" \"Okay fine, we'll get the order started for you right away in that case. Can I have your name, please?\" \"I'll spell it for you; it's kind of unusual. B-A-R-R-A-C-K O-B-A...\""
