Kevin was tougher than I yesterday, riding Flagstaff Ride and filing this report:

> The wind was angry, my Frenz, like an old man trying to send back soup at a deli.
> 
> Once I hit Flagstaff Road, though, I was pretty well shielded from all but the occasional gust. So despite having to pick the gravel out of my teeth after riding up Baseline, it was a pretty decent ride.

Thanks for getting out there and representing, Kevin!!
