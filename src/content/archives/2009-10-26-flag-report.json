      "body": "An anxious moment: tap-dancing down the long shady section just above the Cookie Jar... mostly ice, and slick as hell. I was fine until this low-grade moron in a Ford Eclipse (so big it blocks the sun) zips around... and into the path of an oncoming car. As much as _I_ like me, I know the brain-stem in the Ford considers me expendable. A quick wiggle to the right put me onto the shoulder and even more ice. Like I said, an anxious moment. At least, and I'm assuming here, the guy got down the hill and to his 1 o'clock high-colonic on time. Looked like a photo-finish to me. DU"
