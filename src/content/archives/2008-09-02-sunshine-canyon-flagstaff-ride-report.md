Here's Dave's report:

> Like fair wingÃ©d Mercury, Steve Bailey chased  
> My vanishing shadow up Mapleton Place.  
> "Toward Sunshine!" he cried, "Underwood's there!"  
> "I'll render him pulp as the fox does the hare!" Through turn after turn he tore like a fright.  
> His lungs burned, his legs jelled, but no geezer in sight.  
> For I, like the fox, chose Flagstaff instead,  
> And let foolish young Bailey just race in his head.

Like Amy Winehouse says, [you know I'm no good](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFVM5pVTwkM). I am indeed no good, as I stood Dave up.

Sorry, bud, but the only thing chasing you was your Walter Mitty imagination.
