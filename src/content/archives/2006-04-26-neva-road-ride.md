If you've been waiting for us to post a flat ride, today's your lucky day! We've decided to sail out US36 to Neva Road, then slog our way back along Foothills Parkway and eventually Folsom Avenue. It's a longer ride, usually taking around 115h, so you might want to eat beforehand or take a nice snack. Let's meet at Gate 5 of Folsom Stadium at noon. Hope to see you there!
