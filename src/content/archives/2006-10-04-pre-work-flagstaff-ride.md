It seems the Sunrise/Sunset Table I consulted to forecast daylight is on Mountain Standard Time, so I was overly optimistic that it would indeed be light at 6:15a. As it turned out, it was still dark enough to merit a headlight.

Once we reached the top, however, we witnessed a beautiful sunrise, then headed down for a warming breakfast at Dot's. Thanks to Matt, Adriana, and Espresso for joining me!
