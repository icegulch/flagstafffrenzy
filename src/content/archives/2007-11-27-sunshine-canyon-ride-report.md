Hope these guys don't kill any cyclists...or themselves

Nice little respite from the chilly weather today. Indeed, with sunny skies and temps tickling 60F, it was a lovely day to be outdoors.

Apparently my lonely-sounding posts of late inspired (guilt-tripped?) some folks into joining us. Thanks to Greg and Kevin for sneaking away, and as always to Dave for the good company.

Mr. Leary has requested an [Anemone Duathlon](http://icegulch.com/flag/gallery/Anemone_Jan07) for Thursday, so be sure to bring a bike you don't mind locking up at the trailhead and leaving for 30min or so.

Maybe we'll be lucky and encounter some snow again. Either way, should be a good time. The real question will be: tunnel or trek?
