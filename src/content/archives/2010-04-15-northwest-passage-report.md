Some call it the iPaw

The Coast Guard had it spot on: there were open channels rendering the Northwest Passage navigable. Thanks to a sextant and Rob's keen eyes, we made it back to campus safely.

The passage was not without peril, though. Indeed, the moondust that builds up in [the hairpin corners](http://bit.ly/da5WL7) tugged at our front wheels on the ascent. We usually don't see said dust until July!

###### Notes from the A.M.

Werner claims the distances we bike are "pitiful" compared to [other cyclists](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97Ob0xR0Ut8).

Sean [took some pix](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/BikePathCruise) on our cruise around town yesterday. We were a motley bunch.
