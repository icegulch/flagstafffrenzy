Mr. Leary left his pugil stick at home and exhibited rather docile behavior toward the Frenz, making today's ride quite enjoyable.

Supposedly it's going to snow tonight, but given the bright sunshine, it's hard to fathom. Indeed the clear skies seemed a cobalt skin stretched over the spirey marrow of the Front Range, beckoning the Frenz to camp in their moonlit ramparts. Hmm, sounds like a good idea!

Thanks to Dave and Rob for joining, and even to Matt who got lost looking for the point of departure.
