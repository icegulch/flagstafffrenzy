      "body": "I coulda' used that codpiece today. I forgot and left it at home, hooked up to the charger. (BTW, if you own the Model SS4-36B, don't forget to pull those cables _before_ you put it on. _Oh...my...God_) No matter... I had a delightful ride w/out it today. And it looks like I made my goal of doing Flag with 100Â° bookends. It was minus .49Â° when I left and plus .9Â° when I got back (Foothills Lab).... Good enough; I know I've ridden it when it was at least 101Â°. Mission accomplished, codpiece or no. DU"
