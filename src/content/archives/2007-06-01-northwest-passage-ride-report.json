      "body": "Though I've been sidelined for a while, I've followed the Frenzy situation closely this past week, on tenterhooks to see if K-No would peacefully relinquish the reins of Frenzy power upon SB's return. I half expected a coup attempt, complete w/ tanks and troops surrounding Humanities. etc.. So glad to see no blood was shed and that SB is back in the bunker, pulling the Strangelovian levers of control as if he'd never been away. And if you see K-No loping around the fortress walls, toss him a bone; I think he did a great job!"
