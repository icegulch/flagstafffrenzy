Sugarloaf lotto winner

I pointed the bike up Sugarloaf yesterday, hoping to catch a glimpse of my distant ancestors. No such luck; there must've been a bangup kegger the night before because no one was in sight.

Sugarloaf is a funny ride... the lower part of the road sees million dollar homes with gazillion dollar views. But climb for a while - Primos Road, for instance - and soon enough you're hearing banjo music and wondering how one little chromosome can make so much difference. I've seen people living in cars before (me, if you have to know), but washing machines? Very Deliverance and all within peddling distance of our fair university.

I took the new bike up Flag today. Bloody hot; hitting the creek afterward was mandatory.

Also, I can't believe I'm saying this... I miss Bailey.
