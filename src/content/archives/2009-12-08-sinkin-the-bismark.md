She always liked Steve better

Steve is out today, stricken w/ an illness that has his medical providers thoroughly vexed. While he endures a snowy afternoon of chills, nausea, aching joints and Oprah, I suspect I'll mosey up Kohler Mesa (aka _The Bismark_) and see what's shakin'.

I'll probably bike to Four Pines trailhead, then lock and go.
