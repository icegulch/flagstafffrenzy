Greg, Matt, and Adriana took time away from their busy spring break schedules to duke it out with the freakish dirt slopes of [Northwest Passage](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/routes#northwest).

In spite of a front puncture on the flats, Greg tucked into his aero bars and burned rubber up the 13% grades of Bow Mountain Road. Matt was close behind, giving the seasoned communications liaison a reason to look over his shoulder on future rides.

Adriana wasn't heard breathing at all on the ascent but was overheard chuckling something roughly interpreted as "that was easy" at the top. Though I could feel the spare-tire pounds (from four days of corn chips, beer, and kneeling), I didn't die on the ride.
