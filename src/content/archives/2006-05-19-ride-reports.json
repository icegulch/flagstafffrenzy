      "body": "Thursday: It was awesome watching Noel vaporize the east face Old Stage in his 42/21 _in the saddle_. Bet they could hear the rivets popping from Boulder Heights! And trading chops w/ the guys on the run down Left Hand was a blast! In my humble opinion we made the other lunch-time cyclists out there - and there was a ton of them - look like zombies... Friday: SuperSunshine was a super solar oven today. I was fried from the get-go. I'll be glad when Boulder Creek drops back below flood stage and we can hit the ol' swimmin' hole on the way back to the office again. Great pace today Greg and Steve!"
