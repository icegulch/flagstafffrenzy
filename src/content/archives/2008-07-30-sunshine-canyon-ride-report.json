      "body": "Two Men and a Brain... That's SB and me alright. Halfway up Sunshine we concocted a new goal; biking Flag at both ends of a one hundred degree spread. We've got the high end set at about 101Â° or so, but our southern border is currently only 16Â°, so there's work to be done. If my math is right, we need to pick up another 15Â°. I'd rather do it at the low end. Speaking of dumb, the guy I saw cliff-diving in Boulder Creek today will surely be ejected from the gene pool, if not later this afternoon, then certainly within days... weeks at the outside. I think The Men's Warehouse would have classified this guy as a _Portly_, and the way he abused gravity was breathtaking... I pitied the trout. Yikes."
