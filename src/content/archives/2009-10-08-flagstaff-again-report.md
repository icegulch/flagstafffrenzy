Got around to putting up pix from this summer's New England trip. Here's our 6-Day _Long Trail_ album

Greg saved me from another day of riding alone. Yesterday was my fault, though. Dave actually stuck to the plan after I didn't show, and I just hit Flag.

Greg's been hit with the business end of a nasty chest cold that's leaving his lungs at about 10% capacity. Hope he feels better soon.

Tomorrow looks like fun! Snow? Can you say "Initiation"? Loveland Ski Area [opened today](http://www.denverpost.com/extremes/ci_13498572).
