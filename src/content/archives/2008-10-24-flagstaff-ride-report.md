More of Paul Frederick's fantastic work.

Warmer today—stuck with shorts and short-sleeves for the ascent, adding a vest, wool beanie, and arm warmers only for the descent. The breeze has again cleared skies of haze and added a little refreshment to the climb, especially in the corners. Have a great weekend!

The above video reminds me of the sugar maples in Sugar Hill, New Hampshire. This video was shot in Rumney, NH near where my dad teaches computer science courses, [Plymouth State University](http://www.plymouth.edu/).

I don't see the Frenzy on Comscore's recent [domain rankings](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/web-ranks.jpg) for September—but WordPress is #33. The Frenzy only had 120 unique visits in September. Good news is that only 9% of our total hits were from folks using Internet Explorer.
