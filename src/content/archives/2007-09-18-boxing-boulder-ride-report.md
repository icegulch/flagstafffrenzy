After getting ditched by everyone, Matt and I decided to forgo the planned ride and do Boxing Boulder instead.

Matt has kindly [recorded and published](http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/activity/3993095) all our vital signs from the ride, using his snazzy GPS "watch". As you can see, despite the nagging winds and momentum-busting stoplights, we hemmed in our favorite town rather swiftly.
