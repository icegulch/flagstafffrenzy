The bike path by campus is a little more risky than Bear Creek

I'm not sure even the City of Boulder knows what they're doing with the bike path along Broadway by campus. Sure is a lot of road furniture.

It'll be nice to see the sun again today. It's been a long time...everything's gone numb.

I even forgot how to write for several hours this morning before composing this post. You mean I have to write _three_ sentences to fill up this space?
