If you haven't seen the 1976 film Network, give it a spin

Yesterday the floods inundating Australia made it to Frenzy HQ and nearly snuffed us out. Thank goodness for the escape hatch.

It was great to catch up with Matt Burton this weekend. For those of you who remember the lad, he's now flying big planes that apparently can be put on auto-pilot long enough to make Amy's pizzas and run 5Ks inside the cargo area.

Matt even does his Masters degree work on long flights across the Atlantic. He's taking online courses through the University of Arkansas. Go Razorbacks!
