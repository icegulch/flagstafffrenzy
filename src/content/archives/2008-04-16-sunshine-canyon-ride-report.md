Typical spring weather in Colorado these days. Let it snow!

First time we've been on Sunshine in a while. Nice to test the legs, which is pretty much unavoidable on the super-steep upper grades. The snow flurries were gracious enough to wait until the end of the ride to start falling. Next winter, we should look into [ice bikes](http://www.icebike.org/), huh?

This was Dave's last ride before the vampires get him tomorrow. Good luck, bud!
