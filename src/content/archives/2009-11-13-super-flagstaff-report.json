I'm going to spend the big day (tomorrow/Saturday) in Oklahoma City with some fellow pilot folk doing what we do best: consuming adult beverages and talking to pretty girls. We might even have riding weather here in Oklahoma this Sunday for another 35-miler on the open plains. Everybody stay safe as this next storm hits the Front Range."

      "body": "Looking forward to a moist outing today. Sidebar: It was great riding w/ the newly-paroled Kevin yesterday. Anytime a guy tunnels out to freedom like that, the joy of airy flight is contagious. It was a little sad in some ways, though. Like all cons who find themselves suddenly injected back into mainstream society, equipped with a burlappy gray suit and three hundred bucks, Kevin was a little unsure of how to handle himself. The talking crosswalk signs on Broadway scared the beejesus out of him, and Steve and I had to talk him past a gaggle of young ladies up near that big sorority house on University. Once he got his sea legs, though, he was fine. As we spun our way up Four Mile, he looked over at me and said, \"You know, I could get used to this.\" Then, seething through clenched teeth, \"I ain't _never_ goin' back!\" So, please, _please_ don't tell him he has a meeting today at 11:30. I don't think I could bear to see him crushed like that. DU"
