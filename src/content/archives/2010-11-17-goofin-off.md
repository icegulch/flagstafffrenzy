Dave told me it was perfectly safe

Sorry, guys. I'm at the [Accessing Higher Ground](http://www.colorado.edu/Atconference/) conference this week, so I won't be riding at all. Wicked good session today.

I had no idea what was going on with the weather, being cooped up in a conference room all day. But, it looked like it was crazy!

There's been talk of a [Misery Loves Company](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/routes#mistyvale) ride over fall break. Interested parties should be sure they know their blood type before embarking on this adventure.

Contact HQ if you're interested, and be sure to sign the release form.
