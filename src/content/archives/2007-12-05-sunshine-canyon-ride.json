      "body": "Bailey's a bit of a whiner, don't you think? I mean I got on the bike yeaterday and, damn-it-all, I just went for it. Headed west up Baseline, got slammed around by a few little gusts, collected my so-called wits, hunkered down... then got thrown backward by the mother of all headwinds. Ended up in McCoy Kansas, which is actually a very nice little town. Friendly people and a really cool little museum (world's largest furrowing plow!). By the time I got the Greyhound ticket and got back underway, I realized my lunchbreak was going to run long, so I called Tim and told him I'd be a few minutes late. He's very understanding, that Tim. (Actually I did the smart thing and went out to lunch. Bailey's crazy!)"

      "body": "Riding Sunshine would be cutting it too close to my 1:30 meeting, so I'll head out on my own for a quick ride. Riding in yesterday morning from Gunbarrel was just a treat. The headwind was awful and I had the same crosswind issues that Steve described - I thought my bike was going to get blown out from under me."
