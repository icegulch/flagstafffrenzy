"Drive" is worth a trip to the theater

Really enjoyed the new flic "Drive". It's tense, violent, and highly stylized like "No Country" but it's not as lyrical. Still, my favorite this year. The soundtrack is great too.

Ever been talking to someone who's convinced they've met you before but they haven't and you're quite certain of it? I desperately tried to help someone extract herself from such a scenario last night, but my efforts were in vain.

I've probably done the same.

Cleanup in early October? It'd be a great way to see the colors and do some volunteer work.
