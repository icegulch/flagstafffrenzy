Get ready for riding the Old Stage Road

Thanks to our frictionless wooden wheels and a few horses, Matt and I had a great ride out there today. Felt colder than yesterday at first, but then we warmed up, especially while climbing Old Stage Road itself. Matt got to experience the thrill of getting pulled down Lefthand today, and now he's a born again drafter! Promises to be nice into early next week, so let's do some more road riding while we can. Meantime, have a great weekend, everyone!!
