I was supposed to reveal this yesterday...my new employer

So, after about three years of annoying knocking, my bike is supposedly fixed. U-Bikes to the rescue!

Apparently, the rear hub was worn down bad, so a new rear wheel fixed it. Now I can sneak up on Dave in the vertiginous corners with the old foghorn trick.

I'm curious to see what the new bike lanes on Lee Hill look like. K-No says they're luxurious, so I'm hoping to find some gold medallions I can melt down and resell.
