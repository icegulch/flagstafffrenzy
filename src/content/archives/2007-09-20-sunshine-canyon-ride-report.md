Halloween's approaching

While Halloween is getting nearer on the calendar, you sure wouldn't have guessed it with the warm temps and breezes today in Sunshine Canyon.

Rob, Matt, and I braved the heat and the dizzying grades, forming a formidable though funky posse.

Knowing discretion is the better part of valor, Matt opted to turn around at Poorman Road. Fools that they are, Rob and Steve continued skyward, taking pulls off their water bottles with the indiscretion and fervor of a wino.

Great ride! Looks like the week will finish out with warm temps and sun. Fear not, however: fall is nigh!
