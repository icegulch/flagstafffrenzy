With all eyes on him this year, Cadel Evans [revealed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FikzgWE3t0A) a different [side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9St8xiaKzA) of himself

Dave and I sauntered up Flagstaff today, reminiscing about the comfortable 16Â°F days of winter. Last night I ordered insulated boots from Sierra Trading Post, so this must be part of a larger biorhythm thing. It is almost August, after all. Soon, I'll be chopping and squirreling away wood.

Anyhow, it was great running into Julian, Hideo, and a hefty contingent of the ETS gang shortly after we arrived atop Flag. Good to see you out there, guys!

Dave, how was the creek?

Again, anyone up for a [little run](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&ll=40.054162,-105.570545&spn=0.07818,0.140419&t=p&z=13&msid=106412931864288195098.0004532e94572cd9cb441) this weekend?
