Wet one out there today. Apparently, Kevin and Adriana had some kind of premonition about the impending downpour that Dave and I eventually got caught in, because we saw both of them coming down on our way up. They probably stayed fairly dry, while Dave and I had to wring out our socks back at the ranch.

I saw someone who looked remarkably like Lance Armstrong on the descent, but I can't say for sure....
