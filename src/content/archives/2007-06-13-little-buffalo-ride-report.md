Bike Path Ride

Thanks to Matt, Greg, Adriana, Katie, and Rob for accompanying me on my photo-happy ride along the [14-Mile Little Buffalo](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=106412931864288195098.000001131ce5a18bd8fec&om=1&ll=39.995534,-105.232887&spn=0.124933,0.32135&z=12) course of the upcoming [Buffalo Bicycle Classic](http://www.buffalobicycleclassic.com/).

The photos are actually embedded in the map, so go have a look.

Speaking of the BBC, if anyone wants to ride, there's a team conspicuously called Flagstaff Frenzy. Not sure I'd ride with them, though; they've got a reputation.
