Double-duty post today... Dr. Zeiler and I snuck in a quick Flag under blue skies yesterday. Great ride, lots of bikes. Today, under leaden skies, spinning is the name of the game. Tom and I plan to head east for a good ol' fashioned ride in the country. Wanna' go rustic w/ us? North side of ATLAS at noon. -DU
