This is how Dave teaches Photoshop...tough love

Well, [Flagstaff Mountain](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/routes#flagstaff) was tough today, for it's getting a lot hotter out there. Still, this is nothing compared to what it will be in a few weeks.

Dave wants us to do a duathlon with him this week. I'm thinking Thursday. Takers?
