      "body": "Great video, Dr. Bailey. This may be a bit thick for the Frenzy, but isn't it interesting how these cloud-behavior clips so clearly illustrate the relativity of time? We can't see the true nature of how the clouds are acting until we speed the camera up. Then, at quadruple speed, we can tell exactly what's going on; the relative elasticity of time enables us to detect movements that we previously had overlooked or misinterprated. The same techniques and principles could be applied to Burton on his bike, though quadruple speed may prove insufficient. (This is the Frenzy, after all; serious discussion is vigorously discouraged and trash-talk reigns supreme. Almost forgot!)"
