      "body": "Wow a _black_ skirt! I never even considered that! Plaid is such a pain to keep clean, and sometimes I fear it makes me look a little... well, less than masculine. And speaking of less than masculine, I've turned the greasy details of repairing and tuning my bike over to the guys at Performance. They nearly gagged when I rolled it in. Said it was the filthiest bike they'd ever seen. Well, they _did_ the $70 special included cleaning, so we'll see if they're up to the challenge. It'll be done Tuesday. Until then I'm a runner again. Oh joy. An aside: don't you think \"Scooter\" is a killer prison name?"
