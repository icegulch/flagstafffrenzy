It's not quite Everest, but Flagstaff Sunshine is still a good climb

At the corner of University and Broadway, Dave got a call on the bat phone and had to do an about-face, poor guy. So, TZ and I soldiered on up Sunshine Canyon.

It was chillier than expected, with temps in the low 40s and a not-so-subtle breeze. Even so, we enjoyed the climb and spectacular views of the Indian Peaks, which are still totally white and enshrouded by spindrifts.

Have a great weekend, all!
