My car's been re-outfitted for the gathering storm

It's going to be fun watching the storm roll in this evening. I've got the Weather Underground's cool mashup [WunderMap](http://www.wunderground.com/wundermap/) of Wyoming opened in a tab that I don't intend on closing.

I've always enjoyed watching sharp cold fronts race across states on their way towards meâ€”it's like we're tied to the tracks and [the locomotive's coming for us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5m1A7zoIcc) (trope).

Hopefully, no one will wimp out on _The Blues Ambassadors_ gig tomorrow at 8pm @ [The Boulder Outlook](http://bit.ly/9eaCuc). In view of the forecast, they may have to change this track to "Snowplow Blues":

*   [Steamroller Blues by _The Immortal Blues Ambassadors_](http://ia360931.us.archive.org/3/items/BluesAmbassadorsDoghouseMusic/SteamrollerBlues.mp3 "Steamroller Blues by The Blues Ambassadors")

More obligations today and tomorrow. Sorry folks. Maybe see you on Monday.
