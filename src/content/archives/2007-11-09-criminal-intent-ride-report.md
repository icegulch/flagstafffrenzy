Wow! Breaking the law is exhilarating!

Dave and I set out for the new ride today and ended up picking up a third rider who was looking for a good route. The dirt climbs were tough, what with all the loose, silty gravel, but the weather was just great!

We may tack on Poorman next time, just to add to the challenge. Have a great weekend everyone!

I saw Dave Zabriskie while I was riding home on the bike path yesterday. Makes sense too: the [Team Slipstream presentation](http://www.slipstreamsports.com/news.launch.html) is next Wednesday at Boulder Theater!
