Nothing like messing with Photoshop on a Sunday morning

I've been remiss in publishing the next installment of Crosscurrent, but I assure you I'll have Chapter Two up tomorrow.

So, we need to get serious in planning the next FAC. Greg has suggested after the ITS Winter Staff Appreciation Party. When is that, Greg?

Sounds like the weather tomorrow will be fun. Hope it's not too icy. If so, I'm thinking I might run up Gregory Canyon.
