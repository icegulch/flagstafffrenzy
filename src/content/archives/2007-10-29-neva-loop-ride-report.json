      "body": "The keen eye sees more than a few oddities in young Burton's photo. The rifles; as if the bright orange color weren't strange enough, a cursory glance tell us there are no holes in the barrels. Oh, I suppose the sight of a Day-Glo orange weapon borne by a strapping young lieutenant with good teeth and a deep tan might in and of itself send Commie Johnny into deep apoplexy, the preferred state for one's enemy. But still, for the sake of the occasional savant in the trenches, holes would be nice. And something appears to be crumpled and tightly grasped in MB's right hand. Something hastily hidden from our view, something young Burton would rather we not see. A Twinky wrapper? Answers to this afternoon's exam in advanced avionics? A note from Mom? We can only guess. Burton's companion is wearing rubber gloves. Do you think that's unusual? Are our fighting forces suffering from dishpan hands, fending off ugly rashes and worse? And why is MB so cavalier about his own hands, recklessly exposing them to the raw winds of an Alabama fall day? Is he bucking for a Purple Heart while still in Boot Camp? Or? Answers to these questions and more when MB returns to his friends in December. Can't wait to get the poop!"
