      "body": "This isn't the first time I've done this... The day of my wedding just happened to coincide w/ a time trial out on Nelson Road. I figured I could do the race, then get home in time to freshen up, get married, whatever. But about half way through the gig, one of those \"conjured\" riders appeared just up the road ahead of me. So I chased. And missed a critical turn. And headed for Nebraska, roughly. And the guy behind me followed me. And the guy behind _him_ followed him... etc. etc. It ended up being a very bad day. A few notes; I really missed Burton and his wondertoe out there today. Can't wait to dice it up w/ him while he's still in recovery and feeling awful. And on the way back to the office I saw DM. He asked where we're riding tomorrow. Hope he joins us."

Sheesh...the nerve of that guy! It's not like he's CIO... Besides, Frenzy HQ keeps me in the dark about such things until the morning of, revealing the route to me only after the customary crepuscular flogging, which I endure for you, Gentle Readers! I hope you're thankful."
