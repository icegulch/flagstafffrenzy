Those profs and their bicycles...

We should've christened the day "Flagstaff Faculty Friday" or donned "Brain Powered" tee-shirts, as Noel accompanied us on the ascent and I'm fairly confident I saw Mark Knowles heading down.

The brain-pooling crew was of course on hand as well. Who gets the brain while I'm on vacation, Dave?
