Last night I de-activated my Facebook account because I felt it was useless and an invasion of my privacy

Tom, Dave, and I hit Fourmile Canyon today. The creek was definitely on the rise, inexorably sluicing its way toward the already-swollen Boulder Creek.

I noticed that I'm lacking some endurance, which is probably normal for this time of year. Been riding short rides all winter.
