I'm the Decider!

I can't believe Dad left me the keys to the whole operation. One of my first priorities as the Commander Guy is to send the troops someplace I would never ever go myself. And since I'm tied up with a whole bunch of really important stuff today - manicure, power nap, putting practice in Karl's office - I'll be staying behind while the Frenz do SuperFlag. Telecom at 12:10.

Have fun boys, and don't forget I'll be there with you in spirit. Mostly.
