So, I'm taking suggestions on our next group adventure. Where would you like to go? What day/time? How long? Personally, I like lunchtime rides (11:30-1) that last about an hour. My favorite rides, of course, are hills, including Flagstaff Road, Fourmile Canyon, Poorman Road, and Sunshine Road. Speak up! Let your voice be heard! Vote now!!
