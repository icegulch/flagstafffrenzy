Yes, a weird start time, but I've got a meeting that runs until 12:30pm. So, let's meet on the north side of the Humanities building at 12:40pm and head up Fourmile Canyon.

First we'll ride up Boulder Canyon, then hang a _right_ on Fourmile Canyon Drive, following that until Salina (or however far YOU want to go). Should be another nice day for a ride!
