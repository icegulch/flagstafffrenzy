      "body": "Way to go on that award, Greg! I got mine back in '88, and though I know a lot of people look askance at that little Golden Puck perched on my mantle, it really means a lot to me. And the folks at _The American Urinal Refurbishers Union_ just couldn't be nicer... Once you get to know them you realize they're just like anyone else in the toilet maintenance and reclamation industry. So don't be nervous; the awards ceremony is over in jif, and the meal afterwards is always fabulous! (Don't let the rubber gloves throw you; they always do that to \"newbies.\") J and I found plenty of shade on the Ampitheatre Trail today. Gregory Creek is humming along and it _do_ feel like summer!"
