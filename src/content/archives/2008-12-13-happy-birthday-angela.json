They had the usual assortment of squeaky, stomach-churning rides and threadbare oddities of nature in canvas huts. Standard-issue stuff to be sure; I'd seen it all a thousand times before. It was one of the \"skill booths\" that really got my attention. We'd already worked our way through the ring toss and the paddle-ball arcades when we came to this particular beauty.
