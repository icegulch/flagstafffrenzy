Dave and I had a great ride this afternoon. I think today was the last of the short-sleeve weather for a while, so we soaked it all in.

Unusually strong tailwind on the descent, to the point where I stopped pedaling and was still maintaining about 40mph to the Bridge at Arapahoe. Poorman was in great shape: no fingers of ice across the road and no mud!
