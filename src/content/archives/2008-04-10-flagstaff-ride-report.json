      "body": "SB drew quite a crowd in the ATLAS lobby yesterday as he put the Opracycle 900 through its paces. He gave the TAM kids who were hanging around comparing ringtones quite a physics lesson.

Jaws dropped, oaths were muttered, and bearings overheated. Thanks for the demo, Steve! You earned that 62 oz. Slurpee!"
