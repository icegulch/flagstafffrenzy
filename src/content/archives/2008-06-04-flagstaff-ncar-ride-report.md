Dave calls me this all the time. Now I know how to spell it. (courtesy of Mark)

You heard that right! Today we stepped outside our comfort zone and tackled NCAR. Good call, Rob. Despite Dave's absence, our numbers were impressive: Rob, Noel, Greg, and me.

Often we shy away from NCAR simply because one has to ride the bike path to get there and it's not exactly sheltered from chinook winds. But, after today's double lap, I'm going to dial it up more often. Fantastic ride.

Thanks, guys!
