Dave and I enjoyed a wonderful ride up Flagstaff this afternoon, with only the occasional reminder of the gusty conditions afoot.

Luckily, neither of us crashed and [broke a collarbone](http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2009/mar09/mar23news3). Given my latest poll question (and vote), one might consider me clairvoyant. Knowing the Frenz, tho', I doubt it.
