If the weather holds, if the humidity stays low, and if the backlit leaves shimmer and vibrate like speckled trout in fast-moving water, we can use the German _Verflertaugensteigen_ for Thursday. I'm worried about Friday. In any case, Linden Loop was a super ride. Thanks, Rob and Steve. And speaking of super... Super Tuesday is only a week away, and you can really smell the desperation coming from the McCain/Palin camp. Smells like... defeat. Look for Gollum and Daisy Mae to really crank up the heat on their Obama-left-the-seat-up-again campaign until this whole wretched thing finally pulls up to the curb and shuts off the motor. But now the mud simply won't stick. I think the American people are finally done with this stuff. Mind you, I don't think they're any smarter - after all, these are the same brainiacs who _re-elected_ GWB. I just think it's our turn to get lucky. So, however we get it, let's prepare to savor victory, our delivery from eight years of darkness, incompetence, and swagger. And let's wish La Palin a nice bus ride back to Wasilla, America's little window into the Paleolithic. DU"
