      "body": "Great spinning out east w/ the Frenz today. I was especially fond of our \"missing man\" paceline. My fault; I kept getting sucked back into the propwash and lord knows it's hard jumping back on a moving train. In Greg's opinion the water at the swimmin' hole was a tad brisk. Must've been from that snow in the hills last week. It did feel a bit fresher."
