      "body": "Hey, Suzie!\n\nYou're even pretty than in high school! Do you still have that buckshot scar?\n\nI'm not sure I have your \"tapes.\" You do mean the 16mm reels we shot at the Barnstead Quarries, right? The border patrol snagged them at the Pittsburg crossing (Old Maurice LaBonneville confiscated them and refused to give 'em back). He's still driving that rackety Ford. Can you believe it?\n\nAnyhow, the lighting was low at the quarries that night.\n\nAnd by the way, I know I _sound_ like I'm being rough on that Underwood character, but believe me, Suzie, he deserves it. He makes those lawless Abbotts up in Colebrook Hollow look like saints."

      "body": "I guess Steve forgot about that letter I received from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about his enrollment in Her Majesty's Witness Protection Program. Sergeant Do-Right was very clear that I shouldn't tip off people to Steve's whereabouts. At least Steve didn't entirely reveal his location. He only hinted that he was in one of those Canadian towns that start with V in the Pacific Northwest. The letter from Sgt. Do-Right said Steve was originally facing Interpol charges from carrying bootlegged DVDs across the border and attempting to sell them outside the Walmart at Magog. Fortunately he accepted a plea bargain that allowed him to walk free and assume a new identity. Sgt. Do-Right didn't say much about the DVDs, but he mentioned they were B movies staring Earl Barnes and Suzie Radcliffe. Apparently they were local actors in Bow, NH. So welcome back Steve (if that's really your name) and I'm glad you've made it safe back to your office in Berthoud. Don't worry, your secret's safe with me. :-)"
