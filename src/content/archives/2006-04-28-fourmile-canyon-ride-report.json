Still, it was great to push my limits today, knowing my pedalling pals were doing the same. Tough riding in this warm weather, but it only gets worse from here on out. Good luck with the knife tomorrow, Dave! Thanks for riding Greg, Matt, Adriana, and Davester! **Stats:** _Time_: 24:30 _Distance_: 6.7mi _AVG Speed_: 16mph _AVG Grade_: 4% _MAX Speed_: ~35mph (short downhill)"
