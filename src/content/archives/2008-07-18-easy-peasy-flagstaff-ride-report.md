This is from the IT Community Event Keynote. Great piece!

It seemed cooler today. I think it was the cloud-cover. Or maybe it was the fact that I rode the whole way in my granny gear?

It was nice getting a touch of rain yesterday eveningâ€”hopefully there will be more of the same this evening. It would be swell if the rain would wait until after I'm home, though. I'm tired of getting expensive tune-ups, only to have rain and sand immediately foul things up!

Not many folks riding up Flagstaff this afternoon. Fine with me. How were the trails, Davey?

Good weekend to all!
