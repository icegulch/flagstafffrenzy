More of Steve's music choices foisted upon you...

Saw Dave on his way down today. He had to get back by 13h. Adriana was able to join, though, so I wasn't alone. For someone not having ridden in a while, she's in great shape! Now that she's almost done applying for the NSF fellowship, we hope to see her more.

As an aside, NASCAR?!!! Come on, guys! Are garbage truck drivers "athletes" too? They get thrashed around. Pushing down on a gas pedal?!
