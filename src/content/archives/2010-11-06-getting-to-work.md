I'm confident I could never do this job. My hands are still sweating from watching.

The weather's about to take a turn for the worse, but you'd never know it from conditions today. We're also going to lose an hour of daylight tomorrow, which means I need to make sure all my bike lights are in working order.

But, no matter how bad the conditions on our brumal bike commutes around Boulder, nothing compares to the perils of scaling transmission towersâ€”free-climbing no less!

Dave and I have been talking about doing another FAC at the West End Brewery either the week before or the week of fall break, so stay tuned. Hope you can make it!
