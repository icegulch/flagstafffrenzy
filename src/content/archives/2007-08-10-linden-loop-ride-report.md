Though we did a little Lindy Hopping beforehand, we were all business when riding [Linden Loop](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&doflg=ptm&ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=100713211184899290190.000477a944849ec7f4d2e&ll=40.035501,-105.30241&spn=0.083328,0.136471&t=p&z=13) for the first time in a while today.

Dave crunched the numbers and deemed the ride "safe" for a coumadin patientâ€”I think he uses an old Russian calculator. I'd have to say, he's looking pretty healthy to me.

Mr. U flew up Linden like a [Kazakh on Team Astana](http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/09082007/58/kashechkin-positive-rocks-astana.html), making it tough for drug-free Matt to latch on.
