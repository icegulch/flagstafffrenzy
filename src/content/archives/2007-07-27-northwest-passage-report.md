Matt's drug denials ring fatuous when you see his "results"

Greg, Matt, Adriana and I all endured the dizzying heights of Northwest Passage today.

Matt's been improving dramatically but denies working with the sulfurous _pr√©paratoire_ [Michele Ferrari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Ferrari). Results of his doping tests, conducted today by the Frenz, will be published tomorrow at 10a.
