To be honest, I was just going to skip today's ride. But when I saw Kevin and Brian show up, I knew I couldn't wriggle out of itâ€”if it was just Dave, I would've had no problem ditching.

I'm glad I did ride, though, as we managed to slip in a good workout before afternoon showers and take in the greenery of springtime Boulder. Thanks to Brian, Dave, and Kevin for motivating me to crawl out of the tunnels.

Have a great weekend, everyone!
