It's fine, but what about air bags?

I took possession of the new TrailMaster 1220 last night, and I can hardly wait to see how this baby handles Gregory Canyon today. I just hope Gunther can keep up.

There's some great weather moving in. Zack and I are plotting one last backcountry ski trip this weekend. Should be primo!
