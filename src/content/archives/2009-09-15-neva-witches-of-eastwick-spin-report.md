Nothing stops Dave from his post-ride routine

Excellent showing today! Hideo, Rob, Greg, Dave, and I took a nice ride around our fair town, riding a modified version of _Boxing Boulder_.

Though he peeled off early, Dave was later spotted creekside at his favorite watering hole, as shown above.

Thanks for the great ride, all! These are the kind of rides that stay with you.
