Anyone seen this rider?

The give and take continues. After waiting for Matt like the Gentleman he is, Dave goaded Matt on with a hard charge up Sunshine. Matt didn't bite and allowed Dave a quarter mile lead, which he never regained. To his credit, though, Matt did make it up the steep ramps beyond Poorman Drive.

Dave, concerned about the whereabouts of his young protegé, notified the dairy industry—the first place I call when my pals go AWOL.

Thanks to Dave, Matt, and Kevin for the company. Big 'W' goes out to Kimberly, Adriana, and Greg who claimed it was "too cold."
