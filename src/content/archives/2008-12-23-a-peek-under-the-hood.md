Being here at Frenzy HQ during the holidays is a bit creepy, I must say.

The Dark Lord (SB) has sent the staff home (laid them off, more likely) and the place is deathly quiet. It feels a bit like _The Shining_, though not nearly as lighthearted. Since it's so slow, I've taken to poking around in the back rooms and storage closets, and the stuff I've found is truly heart-gagging. Apparently The Dark Lord's hygiene training got lost somewhere in the shuffle. And I gotta' tell ya': typing with rubber gloves is no cakewallk!

I'm walking today. JG has a theory that my limping is simply a problem of imbalance. She feels certain that if I trash my right knee as badly as the left, voila!, problem solved. We're doing Kohler Mesa and I hope she's right. If you'd like to see science in action, give me a buzz; 2-2672.
