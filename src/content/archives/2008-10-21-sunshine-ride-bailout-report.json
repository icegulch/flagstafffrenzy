      "body": "I must remind iSean that there is precedent. On the very day the somewhat damning Branchflower report was scheduled to hit the bricks in Anchorage, Sarah Palin released a report of her _own_. The result? \"_Palin Clears Self._\" (I first tried this same approach at age five with a broken vase and an errant Super Ball. Sadly, I hadn't yet fully developed my chops.) So you see, iSean, it can be done. And while I celebrate truth as much as the next guy, I fully realize it has its limits. Thankfully, the Frenzy provides safe refuge for \"reality inventors\" like myself, a virtual redoubt, if you will, for those of us who know the road to Truth is straight, flat, colorless, and mind-numbingly dull. Sort of a highway to nowhere (wink). DU"
