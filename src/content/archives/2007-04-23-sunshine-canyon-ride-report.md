Thanks to all the Frenz for making my weekend! Had a great time Friday night and yesterday evening.

Good outing today, and just in time! It started to spit on Greg, Adriana, and me as we made our way back onto campus.

Adriana made it to Poorman and says she felt GOOD. Greg and I went a little farther, and Greg says he felt BAD. I couldn't (and still can't) feel anything. Is that bad, you think?
