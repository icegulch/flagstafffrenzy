The Marks equipped themselves with a little "four wheels of fury" today. Congrats, blokes!

HQ was very happy for two of its lurker members who leveled up today. I wish I could've been there for the announcement (so I could've made a scene), but duty called.

Unfortunately for Dave and me, HQ was inspired by the proceedings and is angling to replace us both. It's a shame too. We were about to launch a print version of the Frenzy that would've been a roaring success and assured our long-term tenure.
