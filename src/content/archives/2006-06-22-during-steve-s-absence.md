Steve foolishly left me the keys to the Frenzy website. How nutty can you get, eh? In any case, I'm gonna' just let it go on autopilot. I figure we can simply rubber stamp this week's schedule until Grizzly Adams returns. Here's what he had:

Monday

Flagstaff/SuperFlag

Telecom

Tuesday

4Mile

Humanities north side

Wednesday

Neva Loop

Stadium, Gate 5

Thursday

NCAR Hill

Telecom

Friday

Gregory Canyon Bridge

All at noon. I guess the meeting places all are that really matter. If we vary from the routes, who'll know, right?
