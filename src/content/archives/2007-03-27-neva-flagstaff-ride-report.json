      "body": "I figured SB must be running late, so I hung out at Gate 5 until 1... Okay, until 12:06 if you have to be so damn particular. Took off on a new route, trying to avoid stoplights; creek trail east to 55th, then South to Cherryvale, over to South Boulder Road, then west to Moorhead. Then a few runs up and down Moorhead. I used to train on Moorhead all the time. A great place to spin. You can go hard as hell w/ no interruptions all the way from Table Mesa up to campus, then back. Great fun trying to stay up w/ cars."
