_MythBusters_ episode Kevin will enjoy

Neva Loop was great today. The air is a little crisper and a little cleaner than it was in the summer.

Sir Brian Kent deigned to join us today, claiming the lords and constables "made him do it." Despite his unwillingness to be there, he rode very strong...for a Brit.

Dave put the functioning chainring to good use, chasing down 18-wheelers, cheetahs, and girl scout troops with ease. I hope he never gets a triple.
