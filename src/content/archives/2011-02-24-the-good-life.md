Very cool story (courtesy of Zack)

Missed riding with the boys today. Sorry, guys. Hope you had fun and blew off some steam. What are rides for, after all? Health? Pul-hease!

Looks like I'll be off to Chicago in the next few weeks, fully [immersed in geekery](http://chicago2011.drupal.org/). I'm going to enjoy it, anyhow. Hope the hotel has a good gym.

Friday's weather is looking dicey. It may be a good day for a scamper. Anyone game? Dr. Werner, that means you too!
