It's still snowing in Frenzyland. Sorry about thatâ€”I haven't had time to change the header graphic. You should still trust the view from your window...if your office has one.

Speaking of which, some prankster put a window in Chamber 185a of Frenzy HQ. Interesting to watch the night crawlers, though.

It appears the _Immortal Blues Ambassadors_ are jamming tonight at the Outlook Hotel, so bring your appetites and rotten tomatos (I hear the chicken wire has weakened).

And in sad news, the "Mortal Blues Ambassadors" passed away this past Tuesday.

Frenzy FAC here in the very near future. Stay tuned. Meantime, bon weekend!
