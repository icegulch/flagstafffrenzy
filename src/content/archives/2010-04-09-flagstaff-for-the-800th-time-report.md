Mark wanted me to post this to make fun of DU, but I would never do that

Dave and I chalked up number 800 today, an unceremonious but spirited ride to the top of our favorite hill.

You'd think local riders would show some respect to the Frenzy Elder, but no! Dave was chastised by a local pro rider for not protecting his noggin with a crash helmet.

Ah, Boulder.

###### Happy Birthday!

Happy 50th to Greg! Have a great Birthday, Bro! You don't look a day over 49!
