We're outta' here. I remember the photographer from the Daily telling me she was interested in shooting \"art pictures\" for their special \"Evolution: A Cosmic Trainwreck?\" issue, but I honestly believed she was just dialing in her light meter until a _real_ curiosity came along. Never expected to see myself in roaring black and white on page three! Record number of cancelled subscriptions the next day, if I recall. Sheesh."
