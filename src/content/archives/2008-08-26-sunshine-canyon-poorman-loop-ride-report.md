Just saw Jeff Spicoli in the class next door. Is it me or did the pizza guy forget the sausage on Spicoli's pie?

Excellent crew out there today: Rob, Dave, and Greg.

Greg showed up despite his frustration with our inability to form a paceline a few days ago. Way to forgive and forget, Stauffer!

We weren't sure about the surface of Poorman Road, but upon closer inspection, we discovered it has recently been watered, keeping the 3-inch deep moondust at bay. Great ride, fellas!

Now we'll see if I get to eat before 5pm today. Maybe I should take a cue from Spicoli....
