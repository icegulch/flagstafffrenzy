      "body": "Today it's the ripple effect. (I actually used to like the Ripple effect. Hard to believe now, given my clean-cut, stand-up image.) TR has had to take an emergency family health day... So I'm babysitting students and Bow Mountain is out for me today. Bummer. I'll be doing something very close to home, like Ho Chi Minh. Better than nothing, but I'll really miss the tilted cobbles! Rain check for next week? Also, aren't the Frenz overdue for another FAC?"

      "body": "I did bike sprints on that little hill below Dal Ward. Bloody miserable, but close to home and effective, I s'pose. Unfortunately, the CU football team had just completed running their reps on the same hill. One of the kids evidently redlined and hurled his lunch halfway up the climb. Guess it wouldn't do to step off into the weeds to eject, would it? Don't these twerps get enough attention w/out marking their territory, too? Sweet Jesus... the Fenz might be tweaked, but at least they have _manners_."
