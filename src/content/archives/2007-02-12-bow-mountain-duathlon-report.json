      "body": "Fun duo w/ Steve today. I love Bow Mountain. It's funny because on any give day Sanitas is clogged w/ people and Bow is deserted. Yet Bow is higher and more dramatic. Great views in every direction and really gnarly sandstone uplifts all along the ridge. And as a bonus there's all the weird stuff on top: the weather station, the bunker, the water tank, etc... And the mailbox. We were really wishing we had a stray NetFlix envelope to slip in there. Check it out sometime. Bow's a nice change of pace."
