Consider [helping Sean](http://www.stbaldricks.org/participants/shavee_info.php?ParticipantKey=2009-338961) (and the kids he's supporting)

Once again, I'm ham-stringed by noon-hour meetings. Hopefully we can rally the troops for fox/hound tomorrow. Four takers so far!

Meantime, I'd like to call attention to a great cause! Sean Myers is participating in this year's St Baldrick's event, which is raising money for kids with cancer.

If you'd like to support Sean, watch him get his head shaved, or get more info about the on-campus event, check out his [sponsorship page](http://www.stbaldricks.org/participants/shavee_info.php?ParticipantKey=2009-338961).
