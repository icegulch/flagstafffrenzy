Dave and I tricked Greg into trying our waterslide loop-dee-loop yesterday

I had forgotten just how steep the ramps of the "Pipecut" trail on Anemone were until I was reacquainted with them yesterday. Great idea, Dave. The Ibuprofen Manufacturers of America thank you.

I need to start organizing our end-of-the-year cleanup. I'm thinking the third or fourth week of September. Hope that will work for everyone.
