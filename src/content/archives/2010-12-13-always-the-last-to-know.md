Wonder what the Daily knows that we don't? (Courtesy of Greg)

Can someone confirm this story? I need to move my mini-fridge if it's true. Besides, we'd need to start planning some big party.

In case you missed it last week, there's a [new installment](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/12/10/crosscurrent-chapter-three) of Dave's serial Crosscurrent, so be sure to carve out some time.

Anyone up for some big adventure over winter break, especially if Old Man Winter stays away a little while longer?
