Congratulations to Mark Gammon, who'll be wearing a "doctoral hood" at the UMass ceremony today

In a feat of superhuman strength, Dave rode up Flagstaff on one of the new, 50 ton Buff Bikes. Simply amazing. He'll definitely need that walker now.

###### This just in!

Apparently there is [air conditioning](http://twitpic.com/5pqqq) at Mark Gammon's graduation!
