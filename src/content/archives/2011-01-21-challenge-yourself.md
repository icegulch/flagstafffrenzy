We "resurfaced" the driveway at HQ recently to make it more challenging

It's Friday here at HQ (and elsewhere, as it so happens), and Dave's friend Steve from Zetroc is in town. About 40 of us have set aside our lunch break to go run with them, so hopefully Steve won't get cold feet on us...figuratively.

In other news, Herr Doktor Tom Zeiler apparently has new wheels and is raring to take 'em for a spin. If we get some dry conditions next week, let's drag him out.

Adriana and I saw [Alegria](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/alegria/default.aspx) last night, the latest _Cirque de Soleil_ performance (now in Broomfield). Those performers have unbelievable skill and nerve! Great show.
