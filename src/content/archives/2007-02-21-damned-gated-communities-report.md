While the turnout was terrific on this sunny day (Adriana, Dave, Kevin, and Brian), the gate at the beginning of Canon View Road cast a pall over things. If you have a teenager who's into vandalism or egging private property, I've got a socially acceptable target for them.

Fortunately, we regrouped and hit the Northwest Passage instead. In spite of a touch of mud and patches of light ice, it was a great yet challenging climb.

Even the winds on the trip out and the sand on the ride down weren't too bad.
