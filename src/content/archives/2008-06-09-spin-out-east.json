Just saw the latest clip from the Gloucestershire Cheese Rolling derby (http://youtube.com/watch?v=OpzEF0D2xfE). I wonder what this would look like if the Frenz tried to pull off the Boulder equivalent? Would we call it Boulder Hippie Rolling? Or Boulder Frosh Rolling? ges"

      "body": "Speaking of cheese rolling, GS borrowed my bike - Widowmaker - for a ride today. I warned him that it was a cantankerous beast, and that it was wont to capriciously toss unfamiliar guests into the weeds. He was feeling brave, evidently, and took off like a flash, claiming he and K-No were going to go \"hammer the biscuit\" out east for awhile. I pictured them cranking 28 mph for an hour straight, up South Boulder Road and back on Lookout or somesuch. Half an hour later they were spotted on the creek trail. Turns out they were trying raise lunch money by match racing the nice ladies from the Fraser Meadows Velo and Needlepoint Club. A quarter a gear to the railroad crossing and back. Bad day for wagering, though... I had to lend GS five bucks when he returned the bike."
