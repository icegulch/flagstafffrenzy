Geez, Zack, leave some for the lesser fishermen!

That's right: Super-Sunshine! Matt foolishly agreed to go "all the way up" with me today.

Much to my chagrin, however, he labeled the ride "solid medium effort". Either he's getting better or he's been inhaling more than his deodorant spray in the adjacent cube. Mercy!
