Wow! Greg hit Fourmile hard today, and he says Fourmile hit back, though I'd beg to differ (I had Greg with 42 punches to the road's 23).

Mr. Stauffer threw down an impressive 29:00 on Fourmile, eclipsing DU's 29:29 of a few years ago. An ambulance had to be summoned to cart off Dave's ego, so he wasn't available for comment after his record was shattered.

The season is early still, so I expect Greg's time to come down precipitously. The same goes for DU, who hasn't been stopping beside the road and playing dead, so that's a victory right there.

Greg's sure he can hit 27:00, but I'm thinking he can do better: 26:00 by fall. The trick is not to go too hard at the start, and Stauffer says he did just that today.

I'm fired up by Greg's intensity! Let the Frenzy fireworks begin!!
