Oooh! Another heist filmâ€”one of my favorite genres. And it's set in Beantown!

Not only has Noel not lost an ounce of fitness, but he's also got a new Orbea, which makes him _muy rapido_. Just what we need!

Still, it's good to have him back, even if we nearly exhausted ourselves chit-chatting on the ascent. Sorry about that, Noel. Dave calls me Soliloquy Steve for a reason.
