Rob and I had every intention of riding up Sunshine, but then, of a sudden, we chose Flagstaff instead. So far this week, I'm two-for-two.

Today was warmer than yesterday, but it was still quite humid. Rob and I were both put off by the brown cloud, which came into view as we rose above it. Probably not good for our lungs!
