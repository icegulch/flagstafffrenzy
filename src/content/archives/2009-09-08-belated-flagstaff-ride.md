Whirlwind trip this weekend to Canada. Adriana's flight to Denver got delayed, so she arrived 2.5hrs later than I in Edmonton. Still, amazing 24hrs in Jasper Provincial Park!

Professor Tom Zeiler asked us to hold up normal proceedings and ride with him at 1:15p. Wish granted. Gather at 1:15p @ ATLAS main entrance.
