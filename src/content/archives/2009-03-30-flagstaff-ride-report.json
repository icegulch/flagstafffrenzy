      "body": "Dave and I argued our way up the footpaths to Mapleton. He says he has his voice back, but you wouldn't know it from the feeble debate style he used. Good scream as I pushed him off the cliff, though. It was his favorite cliff. Not even funny, is it? He wasn't wearing a helmet and no, I didn't really do any of that stuff I said."

      "body": "I did have quite the walk w/ our own Gitmo Girl, Jennifer yesterday. Yes it's true; she hectored and abused me almost every step of the way. I'm still wasted. I don't mind hitting the trails in the orange jump suit - it's my color, really - but the hood is a real pain in the arse. So stuffy! I've run the Grand Canyon, biked Trail Ridge Road, and sat through a Mormon wedding, but nothing in my otherwise tepid life compares to the verbal manslaughter I routinely endure on these (death)walks with the Gunthenator. I Blackberried Obama to see if she could be phased out or off-lined, but, like with Blackwater, the most I realistically think I'll see is a name change. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss... DU"
