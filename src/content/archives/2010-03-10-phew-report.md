Dave and Lindsey helped lend actual talent to the latest Steve Bailey joint

Today, iSean drew my attention to a story about Google now plotting bike paths on their maps! And indeed, Boulder is [one of the 150 US cities](http://bit.ly/c3Pqjd) with plotted bike paths. Yay!!

Remind me sometime to tell you about all the tom-foolery surrounding Dave and I filming in the men's room. Man, that was just ripe for bad puns.

###### Report

It's time for soup. The snow is beautiful on Flag today, but I might soon appear in "Frozen Dead Guy" days if I don't get some warm sustenance!
