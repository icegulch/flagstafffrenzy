Somehow it doesn't make sense that we had a headwind in three out of four of the cardinal points, but it was still a lot of fun spinning today. What a great crowd too, which made the pedalling easier:

*   Dave Underwood
*   Matt Burton
*   Greg Stauffer
*   Rob Leary
*   Kevin Notheis
*   Steve Bailey

When we get clearance from Dave's Doc, we'll hit the hills again. \[Dave says he was riding pain free again, which is bad news for all of us who benefitted from his sore knee.\]
