      "body": "I agree w/ JG about the fast forward; I clawed for the damn thing. And once the tape started rolling, I had this sick, visceral feeling I used to get when the attendant strapped me into the Tilt-O-Whirl at the Whizbang County Fair, this feeling of helpless, round-eyed surrender, of knowing that, for the next X minutes, my life and my lunch would be in someone else's hands. But it wasn't all that bad, in retrospect. I made it all the way through the video in one piece and now I feel stronger for it. This may, in fact, be one of the better New England high school snuff films I've ever seen... admittedly a very thin niche. Great ride down Boulder Canyon today, eh Steve? Gotta' love a determined tailwind. DU"
