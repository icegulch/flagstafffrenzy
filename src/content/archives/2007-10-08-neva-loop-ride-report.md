I want one of these for splitting wood tonight

Noticeably quieter out there today. No deceitful I think I'm going to take it easy today statements, undermined by vicious attacks in the last mile. No age jokes. Nothin.

Despite the deafening silence, Dave and I encircled Boulder Reservoir and battled its relentless breezes, holding off a 70 year old nun who clung to our wheels like fresh tar on tires.

Hopefully we can do fox/hound at lunch sometime soon, and Dave's jonesin' for a duathlon. Let us know if you have preferences.
