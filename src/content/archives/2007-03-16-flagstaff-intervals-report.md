A different type of intervals

Due to silly lunchtime meetings, I hit Flagstaff early today, subjecting myself to four painful intervals in The Hole.

Overall, I think I rode at a wise pace that still delivered a tough workout. The weather was perfect: slightly cool, dry, and not too sunny. I hope the rest of you had good workouts, whether they involved hills, flats, or weights.
