Dave, be careful riding on the dirt today!

Perfect riding weather today (just on the edge of too hot for running). Looks like more of the same in the forecast too.

Adriana, Greg, Kevin, Matt, and I powered up Fourmile Canyon today. Matt decided Fourmile wasn't hard enough, so he tackled [Poorman](http://www.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=Pleasant+St+%26+Macky+Dr,+Boulder,+CO+80302&daddr=university+and+6th+ave+boulder,+co+to:arapahoe+and+4th+st+boulder,+co+to:fourmile+canyon+and+poorman+rd,+boulder,+co+to:mapleton+and+4th+st+boulder,+co+to:mapleton+and+4th+st+boulder,+co+to:6th+and+university+boulder,+co+to:6th+and+university+boulder,+co+to:6th+and+university+boulder,+co+to:pleasant+st+and+macky+dr+boulder,+co+to:pleasant+st+and+macky+dr+boulder,+co&layer=&sll=40.024755,-105.327902&sspn=0.016103,0.030899&ie=UTF8&z=13&om=1) instead. More power to you, cube-mate.

Since we were going hard, you might hear us clearing our throats in meetings this afternoon, so please cut us some slack.

Fox/Hound next Tuesday after work!
