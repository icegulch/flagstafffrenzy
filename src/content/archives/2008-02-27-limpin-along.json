      "body": "I still haven't figured out how Dr. O'Leary cheated. I had him at the last crossing, and was up by at least 30 seconds... a sizable chunk for that part of the mountain. There was a bit of a tapdance getting around the gate through the snow, but I was back on task again in short order. By the time I hit the finish line, he was already there, rested, cooled, and dozing in the sun. Go figure. (Great run, Rob!)"
