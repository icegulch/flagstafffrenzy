After a morning of non-stop knocks at my door, phone calls, and emails (which, incidentally, have not slowed up at all this afternoon), it was so nice to get out on the bike with my pal Dave.

Dave reminded me that life is all about suffering and hardship, and that I should quit my whining. Then he spat on me. What a great friend. I felt much better upon our return to campus.
