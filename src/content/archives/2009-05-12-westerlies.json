      "body": "Oh joy! NW Passage twice in two days. That's a bit like happy hour for root canals. At least Noel and the Fightin' Raudzens-Baileys were there to help shoulder the pain. Thanks, guys! And speaking of dentists... For those of you who have never seen flies soaring on thermals, this is a great time of year to swing by the men's room on the first floor of the ATLAS building. For much of the month of May, these magnificent insects make the first floor men's room their home before moving on to the north in vast nomadic clouds. For those with the patience and fortitude to sit quietly and observe, the rewards are great; seeing these awesome creatures scud effortlessly above their kingdom of porcelain and chrome inevitably gives one a lump in the throat and a \"heapin' helping\" of goosebumps. Tours are available. Call (303) 239-4100 for details. This is a great experience for young and old alike!"
