The _Tour of Flanders_ is this Sunday. Lemme know if you want to watch...

All kinds of challenges on today's [Boxing Boulder](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/boxing_boulder.gif) ride.

First, Mr. Burton thought his legs were sapped from a long mountain bike ride yesterday afternoon. As it turned out, his rear breaks were rubbing (bad!).

Mr. Notheis is still repairing his road bike, so he decided to ride his new Marin instead. Fortunately for us, the upright position of the Marin made Kevin a great person to ride behind, but he had double the workout we did.

One thing's for certain, we all envied Greg's Ã¦ro bars. The winds were relentless, and we even had a Frenzy first (in my recollection): rain drops. Truly mixed bag today!
