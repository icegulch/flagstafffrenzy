      "body": "I saw Mr. Kent also. At first I thought it might be a ghost or some obscene trick of atmospheric distortion. But as the distance between us decreased, I noted the singular outward characteristics - the see-sawing motion of the bike against the violent rise of the mountain, the shoulders hunched and taut in a powerful knot of aggressive energy, the foppish pink bandana - that indelibly stamped the struggling figure as none other than the legend himself. I was at once awed and appalled, and just as he swept by me on that icy alpine rampart, I caught a fleeting glimpse of a man possessed. We closed then parted, and as he slogged away into the swirling mists, I could swear I heard him say, \"I hate this cold weather; it makes my Poly-Grip feel like axle grease.\" And then he was gone."
