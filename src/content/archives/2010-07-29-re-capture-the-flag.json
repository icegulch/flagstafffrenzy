      "body": "Ronna and I were in the audience the night Bret's _Airborne_ video was recorded. I'm glad the \"APPLAUSE\" sign didn't show up in the finished clip. The performance came out really good on tape, but I'm sorry they cut the part where Bret stage-dived and completely missed the crowd (me and Ronna and Ernie, a homeless guy who was there for the free IPA's and chips). He got kind of banged up, but he's one tough monkey, it seems. Any hoofers out there today? I'm headed for McClintock again today. 2-2672 if you want a good laugh. DU"
