The heat was intense today. Greg—trooper he is—spun up at a spirited clip, unfazed by the scortching sun. Matt and I noodled at a more pedestrian pace.

Hot indeed! It was the kind of day when the [seeds from lodgepole pine are released](http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/colville/hfi/ecosystems/index.shtml). I saw a few popping off trees like popcorn!

I'm ready for fall.

Construction on Flagstaff wasn't bad, though we did get held up on the return trip (they were taking lunch when we ascended).

We had to zip over a freshly set patch of asphalt during the descent, which conjured images of [Joseba Beloki in the 2003 TdF](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_8m5-sR6I4) for me. Ouch!
