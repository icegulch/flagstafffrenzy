Kind of a sad day today: the last before the students return to campus _en masse_ and biking around becomes infinitely more dangerous.

Still, it was a nice one. It's warm out, but there's still a hint of Greeley in the air, which is to say a smell vaguely resembling Kevin's biking gloves and which is to say the wind is blowing from the north and that Kevin's gloves need to be washed thoroughly.

Anyhow, good luck to all who are dealing with the return of the kids. Have a great weekend!
