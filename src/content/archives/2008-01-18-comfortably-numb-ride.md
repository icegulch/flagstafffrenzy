Man, I knew those Media Services guys were surly, but this is over the top

Desperate, I begged faculty, colleagues, and even big-wig suits to make a lunchtime appointment with me today. To no avail! I'm forced to go out with the discontents.

I've prepared for the cold temps by injecting dangerous quantities of collagen, to the point where I may no longer need to wear biking shortsâ€”didn't read the "recommended dosage" label carefully enough.

In any event, I'm ready. Given the blustery forecast (again), let's plan on a Telecom rendezvous @ 12p and a Flagstaff itinerary.
