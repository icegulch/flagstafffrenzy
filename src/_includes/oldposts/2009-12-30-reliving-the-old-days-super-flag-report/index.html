  <div class="center"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/icegulch14/SteveSUSFSDays2001"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_MLtKexEhbk0/Szt4VNA5evI/AAAAAAAAN3w/TAZfsGOzbuk/s800/001.jpg" width="500" /></a><br />My former-colleague and pal Jeff Smith just sent me <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/icegulch14/SteveSUSFSDays2001">some old pix</a> from my USFS days. Now I'm nostalgic.</div>
<p>That was cold. Temps at the Mesa Lab were hovering around 26F, but conditions were surprisingly dry.</p>
<p>Four "feeder" streets leading to Baseline are "open" to non-studded tires. I chose to ride up 16th and down 9th, but 6th and 13th are ice-free too.</p>
<p>Everything else is dry with the expected amount of sand for this time of year. It's good all the way up to the top of Super-Flag, save for one or two icy spots in the last hairpin.</p>
<p>I saw a few mountain bikes below the Flagstaff House (on their way down), and one guy heading up at the 'S' curves as I was heading down; otherwise, the road was mine...</p>
<p>Except for all the tourists, of course. Two cars stopped to cheer me on. One person told me "You're amazing." I wish I had some clever reply but I was fighting to keep down the footlong VeggieMax sub and three chocolate chip cookies I inhaled 20 minutes prior to riding.</p>
<p>Oh, and my prediction from yesterday (that my legs would be woefully sore) was dead on!</p>
