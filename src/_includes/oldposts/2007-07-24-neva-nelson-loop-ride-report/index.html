<p>Thanks to Greg and Matt for joining me on an extended "Neva" ride today...we rode Nelson Road instead.  Lots of hot, gusty winds but fun just the same.</p>
<p>My <em>Tour de France</em> predictions are coming true.  I believe I had Vino in first place, barring a positive dope test (Ferrari can't win them all), and Contador in second, provided he too wasn't linked to Fuentes, Ferrari, or whomever he's <em>undoubtedly</em> working with.  It doesn't matter who rounds out the top five, as I had all of them doping too.</p>
<p>For me, the news about Vino's positive <strong>is NO surprise at all</strong>.  I'm very happy.  I really love cycling, but I hate cheaters more than I love a silly sport.  I know cycling is not alone&mdash;I mean, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2182405">a punter was busted for juicing</a> in March 2005...A FREAKIN' KICKER!</p>
<p>Greg half-jokingly thinks there should be separate pro-drugs/anti-drugs leagues, and I half-jokingly agree with him.  Still, somehow I foolishly think sports promote a healthy lifestyle. You?</p>
