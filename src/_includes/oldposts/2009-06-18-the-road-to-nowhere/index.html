<p>We've lost the Baileys.</p>
<p>Frenzy HQ was tracking them last night at about 11:15 PM when, inexplicably, they went missing. It could be a problem with the Frenzy GPS, but we just put fresh batteries in it last week, so that's not likely to be the cause.</p>
<p>No, sadly, the more probable explanation is peat moss. New Hampshire is roughly 95% peat moss, and if SB has pulled one of his typical shenanigans and gone off-trail in search of adventure, then all bets are off. We'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>And speaking of roads to nowhere... Kevin is lobbying for the NCAR ride today. Noon. I'm not sure yet where he's staging. Buzz him.</p>
<p>I'm more interested in Four Mile today. Buzz me if you'd prefer a road to somewhere; 2-2672</p>
<p>DU</p>
<p>iSean Edit: K-No and I are doing NCAR at noon, meeting up at the <del">construction site</del> TCOM.</p>
