  <p>You've gotta love spring break.  No students and less meetings to distract Frenz from their primary duties: riding.</p>
<p>Today was a case in point: our numbers swelled from 1.5 to 4 (I only count as 1/2 man...other half machine)!  No oblivious skateboarders.  Thinner traffic.</p>
<p>Thanks to Greg, Kev, and Dave for joining.  The breeze was negligible once the road tilted uphill, and our conversation ran the gamut from offshore tax shelters to future adventures.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, who would be interested in a summertime Frenzy Tour of Colorado?  I'm thinking we could do a supported ride through the Rockies, camping out or hitting B&Bs and having support cars to carry all the peripherals.  Sound like a good time?  I'm sure we could arrange it so that trail runners could join in the fun too.</p>
<p>Sean can whip up Gumbo every night.  Who could resist that?!</p>
