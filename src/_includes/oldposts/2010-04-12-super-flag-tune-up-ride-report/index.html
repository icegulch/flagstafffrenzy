<p><em>Father Time</em> kept us from putting the "super" in Flagstaff today. But such prefix privations do little to dampen our spirits.</p>
<p>It was cooler than expected at the start, so both of us did our respective about-faces in order to grab an extra layer for the descent.</p>
<p>As is always the case, however, we warmed quickly on Baseline, and by Gregory Canyon we were like steamed lobsters (with rubber bands around our claws).</p>
<p>No rubber bands on Dave's freshly tuned bike, though. Indeed, a big "thank you" to Eric for neutralizing that squeaking noise. I think it was actually Dave's knees, not the old crankset.</p>
<p>Looks like Zack is <a href="http://warnercnr.colostate.edu/fwcb-home/">showing up the old man</a> at Colorado State! But Dave was <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/04/11/black-cats">published on the Frenzy</a> recently, so touch√©, Zack!</p>
