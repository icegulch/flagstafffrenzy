<p>It was good to noodle down University with Dave and Boulder Berly during the first part of the ride.</p>
<p>At 6th and Arapahoe, we parted ways, with those turkeys going up Fourmile and this turkey going up Sunshine.  But they should've followed me for a minute longer....</p>
<p>At the junction of 6th and Canyon, I got to see <a href="http://www.tomdanielson.com">Tom Danielson</a> waiting for the light on the other side of the road.  He was with <del>some other Garmin support guy</del> <ins>Scott Owens of <a href="http://www.coloradopremiertraining.com/">Colorado Premier Training</a></ins>, who was on a scooter.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the climb up Sunshine was great: Colorado dry with 76&deg;F temps, which is ideal for this time of year.</p>
<p>After climbing Sunshine, I dropped down to Fourmile via Poorman and spotted the turkey vulture duo nearing the Poorman junction, so of course I attacked to beat them to Crisman.</p>
<p>Turns out, the joke was on me, for they must have turned around there.  I rode up to Crisman, then back to Poorman and up over to Sunshine again in the hope of bugging them.  No such luck.</p>
<p>Hope y'all had fun!</p>
