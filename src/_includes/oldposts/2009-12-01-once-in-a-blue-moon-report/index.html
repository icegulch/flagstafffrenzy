<p>Welcome to December, Frenz. This is a special month in the heavens, as we'll have not just one but two full moons! The second full moon is technically a "blue moon" and occurs only once every two or three years.</p>
<p>If we get some good snow, it'll be a good night to ski and camp. Oh, and there'll probably be a beer or two chilling in a snowbank.</p>
<p>No sharp drops in temperature during today's ride, but it was certainly cooler than this morning when I rode in.</p>
<p>Managed to make it up to the Amphitheater Road but not all the way to the Amphitheater itself. Meetings....</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my partner-in-crime Dave was torpedoed by a meeting with a student. Did they even show, Dave?</p>
