<p>Adriana and I stayed up until almost 1am to watch the eclipse. Today, we will pay for our wee-hour watching.</p>
<p>Still, it was worth it. At precisely 12:40a, the moon was totally in the earth's shadow. And at that very moment, the coyotes in the open space near our house started baying like crazy. Not sure if they knew what was going on, but it was pretty magical!</p>
<p>I'd say the color of the moon wasn't so much a "copper red" (as predicted) as a burnt orange. Anyone else see it?</p>
