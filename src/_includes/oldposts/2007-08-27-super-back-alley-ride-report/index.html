  <p>If you're ever feeling tired and rather unmotivated, you should give Super-Back-Alley a try.</p>
<p>Super-Back-Alley was not a planned ride, mind you; it was more of a series of navigational mistakes that added a mere mile or two to the already epic <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pjFl_x68koK1QxpaVPC16g?feat=directlink">Back Alley</a>.</p>
<p>Don't believe me?! You should have a look at the Google Earth overview produced by Mr. Burton's little GPS watch.  It clearly shows the ride was orchestrated by the troubled mind of a madman.</p>
<p>I can't count how many times the phrase <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2007/03/05/linden-loop-ride-report">Steve Rule</a> was whispered behind my back by Greg and Matt.  Hey, honest mistake, boys.</p>
