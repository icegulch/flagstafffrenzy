  <p>Thanks to all the Frenz for making my weekend!  Had a great time Friday night and yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Good outing today, and just in time!  It started to spit on Greg, Adriana, and me as we made our way back onto campus.</p>
<p>Adriana made it to Poorman and says she felt GOOD.  Greg and I went a little farther, and Greg says he felt BAD.  I couldn't (and still can't) feel anything.  Is that bad, you think?</p>
