<p>It was a sizzler today.  Poor Rob forgot his water bottles at home, but we occasionally biked past some sprinklers to let him catch a few drops.</p>
<p>Mr. Burton was as fiesty as ever, mounting a formidable sprint on Baseline.  Toe-schmoe, I say!</p>
<p>Well, this is my last official post for a month.  I'm leaving you, O' Gentle Reader, with a table of who will be posting from here on out.</p>
<p>All complaints should be directed at them.</p>
<p>I may make a post or two from Vancouver, and I'll include pix from the road.  Meantime, be safe and happy! Take care, fellas and gals!</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: Sean Myers says he's going to ride with us...hold him to it!</p>
