<p>Surprisingly good conditions today! I think both Dave and I were prepared to turn around at the first sign of ice, but there wasn't a patch to be found.</p>
<p>In fact, the road was completely dry!  The lower section (up to the Amphitheater service road) didn't even have much sand; the upper portion resembled the dunes of the Sahara.</p>
<p>Coming down the super-section, I did ungracefully dismount rather than try to dune-buggy my way around the beachhead hairpins.  This made for an unusually long descent, wherein large shavings from my brakepads were discarded roadside.</p>
<p>While carefully picking my way down Heartbreak Hill, imagine my surprise when I saw Brian Kent (not a typo!) climbing on his lime-green Bianchi.  He even suggested we may see him on wheels tomorrow too!</p>
<p>Given the unknown trajectory of the impending storm, tomorrow's itinerary will be up in the air until the morning.  If we can sneak in a ride, we will likely hit Flagstaff again or possibly Sunshine.  If it's snowing, we may settle for a duathlon at Sanitas.</p>
