<p>Today, <em>The Replacement</em> filed this ride report:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Ah, October. The turning leaves, the smell of pumpkin pie in the air, the sight of a Trunk Monkey blazing past on the side of the road.<br /><br /> 
I guess some of us have different Octobersâ€¦<br /><br /> 
Neva Road was beautiful today; a bit chilly getting started, but downright warm by the end of things. Other than that, a pretty standard ride, with The Replacement going from one end of the pack to the other, Sparky keeping a pretty nice pace throughout (I think she was practicing for when sheâ€™s on the lam for setting her building on fireâ€¦), and OT Steve providing some of that cool optimism as always.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt has filed another report from Alabama:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The attached photo is of Officer Trainee (OT) Bogle and myself, OT Burton.  We just finished up our very first MREs, which were quite delicious.  We finished Small Unit Tactics I & II that morning as well as land navigation.  Tactical communication and first aid comprised the afternoon after the photo.<br /><br />
We agreed that we would both do Super Flag ten times back-to-back instead of going through OTS if we could.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Don't worry, Matt.  We'll make sure you get your 10 Super-Flag wish upon your return in December.  Please come prepared.  Thanks for measuring the difficulty of OTS using the "Frenzy Scale".</p>
