<p>Two announcements before today's report.</p>
<p>First, I encourage you all to rock the vote, and help <a href="http://www.barbie.com/vote/">Barbie choose her next career</a> as a computer engineer!</p>
<p>Secondly, I tried to cajole iSean into riding this afternoon, but he revealed he only ventures outside when <a href="http://obama-weather.com/Obama/m/80301">Obama is wearing shorts</a>. Sean, I'll have you know I ran this by my cronies at NIST, and they determined that this "Obamameter" is improperly calibrated. Today was in fact "Obama shorts weather."</p>
<h6>And Now for Today's Report</h6>
<p>Wow, it's warm out there. Rob joined me on this afternoon's ride, where we pointed our front wheels at Sunshine Canyon and pedaled out of the slush-ice and into the sun.</p>
<p>Indeed, the "canyon" lived up to its name, showering us with sunlight once we emerged from the dreaded icebox.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the icebox's bark was worse than its bite, and we managed to get down slowly although safely.</p>
<p>Thanks, Rob!</p>
<h6>From This Morning</h6>
<p>We finally took the ornaments off the tree last night, then snipped the branches and tossed them in the fire. Does the latter act make me a bad person...kind of a retroactive-Grinch?</p>
<h6>Happy Birthday, Scott!</h6>
<p>It's my brother's birthday today! I heard San Diego had 70F temps recently, so hopefully he'll be able to get out for a spin on his freshly tuned Scattante. I'll be thinking of you, bud!</p>
