  <div class="center"><img src="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DU.jpg" alt="report" width="350" /><br />A reminder: this textbook is property of the Frenzy. Please treat it accordingly.</div>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/06/30/dont-worry-be-happy">"Don't Worry, be Happy"</a> makes it painfully obvious that the writer is beyond hope, and that his "problems" are considerably less important than, say, the backside of Neptune. Honestly, <i>who the hell cares?</i> 
Don't even answer this question. We're sorry we brought it up. 
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Do you think the author writes like this for effect? What effect? Why does it fail?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dave Underwood spells out the word &quot;s-e-x.&quot; Did he have help?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pretend you're riding bikes with the author and that he asks that you &quot;slow down so we can wring the very marrow out of life.&quot; Would you speed up to get clear of this cloying psychobabble? Most people do, by the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using paper clips and masking tape, make a scale model of Dave's bike. That should keep you busy until lunch, when we'll go ride Cedarbrook... unless you have a better idea.</p>
