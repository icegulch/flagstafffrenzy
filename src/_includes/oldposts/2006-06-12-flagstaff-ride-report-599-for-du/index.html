<p>What a ride today!  We were able to test out the new drivetrain we got Dave (see photo at left).  He reports that he LOVES it!  The crankset is a Ritchey compact (50/34), with 172.5mm crank arms&mdash;much better for a tall guy like Mr. Underwood.</p>
<p>We also got rid of the old cluster, replacing it with a <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/DaveS600thFlagstaffRide#5395273465504706498">new 12-28 cluster</a>.  So, if you're out on Poorman tomorrow, that hummingbird noise buzzing by you is Dave spinning his new drivetrain.  Rounding out the new equipment is a new chain, cuz why burn a new crankset and cluster with an old chain!</p>
<p>Other frills that were throw in (for Dave's own personal safety): headset tightening, brake tightening, brake hub adjustment, and front wheel truing.  Now, with all this newfound speed and knee-saving efficiency, Dave needn't worry about breaking his handlebars or losing control on the descents.  <strong>Don't miss Wednesday's ride!!!</strong></p>
