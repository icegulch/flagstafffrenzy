  Bow Mountain Ride Report

  <p>Dave got stuck in the office today, so Rob and I had a decision to make: to ride Bow Mountain or something else.  Since Rob had never been, we opted to go for it.</p>
<p>On top of braving the paved part of the ride, Rob actually rode the whole way up the dirt/gravel part to the "benches."  First time!  An impressive feat.  Greg is no longer the only one who's ridden the whole thing continuously.</p>
<p>Anyhow, today is the day Mr. Burton returns.  When we'll see him is anyone's guess at this point.  I should contact my retired USAF Colonel uncle to see if we can get him a furlough or whatever they call it these days.</p>
