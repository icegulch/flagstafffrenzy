<p>With snow in the forecast, we deemed Super-Flag mandatory today.  What a perfect one too, with temps around 41&deg;F and a beaming sun!</p>
<p>Dave ran into some d&eacute;railleur troubles near the top, leading us both to conclude that it's high time we clean our bikes.  Perhaps we should do a Frenzy bike wash on the quad.</p>
<p>Ran into a favorite author of mine today at the height of land (atop Super-Flag).  Very cool!</p>
<p>I used to teach his work at <a href="http://www.unh.edu/">New Hampshire</a> and <a href="http://www.pitt.edu">Pitt</a>, and when not parsing Derrida's sentences for my own comprehension, I used to devour his books and short stories.  Nice guy who can climb on the bike too!</p>
<p>As an armchair mountaineer, I feel obligated to remind you guys that tonight and tomorrow night the <a href="http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainculture/festivals/2006/film/awards/default.asp">Banff Mountain Film Festival Tour</a> is showing at the <a href="http://www.bouldertheater.com/">Boulder Theater</a>.  Some of the award winners this year are really inspiring, and some are just plain scenic!  Get out to catch a showing if you can.</p>
