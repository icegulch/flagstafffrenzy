<p>Dave and I decided to do a fun ride today; after all, you have to keep things interesting during the oft'-foul-weather-maintenance phase of the year.</p>
<p>And interesting it was!</p>
<p>It all started with a poor dog who had undoubtedly escaped from a frat house nearly getting hit by a car right before our eyes. Fortunately, I was able to yell to the woman driving the car to stop just in time. After that, however, I don't know how that pooch fared...he was weaving in and out of the road.</p>
<p>Some Freds just shouldn't keep pets!</p>
<p>Next, as we were climbing the steepest section of Sunshine, we saw some poor tractor-trailer driver break down right in the blind, 25% corner. OUCH!</p>
<p>To top it all off, we saw someone getting carted off in an ambulance on 4th Avenue.</p>
<p>We began to wonder if we should call ourselves "The Angels of Death," but when we saw that no harm befell the guy fixing the company wood-chipper on 4th Ave, we figured everything else was just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Or is that why no one rides with us anymore?</p>
<p>Anyhow, <em>Reverse <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pjFl_x68koK1QxpaVPC16g?feat=directlink">Back Alley</a></em> is a hoot, especially when the dirt sections are tacky "Texas Tarmac."</p>
