<p>Two things struck me yesterday as I crawled out from under the anesthetic. 
<p>One; as a recreational drug, cortisone has some catchin' up to do.</p>
<p>And two; my doctor. She rapped me across the snout w/ her stethoscope and told me this time I really need to take it easy <i>or else</i>.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm tired of pumping drugs into you, then seeing you back on the Frenzy with your delinquent pals the very next day. This time, I mean it: TAKE IT EASY! You're not a kid anymore... Hell, <i>you're not even middle-aged anymore.</i>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you're saying wait until, like, Wednesday?&quot;</p>
<p>Another instant, sharp ding with the 'scope told me that that was possibly the wrong guess.</p>
<p>So let's make it Thursday.</p>
<p>(I think Steve is buried again today and I'm under house arrest. Woe is us!)</p>
