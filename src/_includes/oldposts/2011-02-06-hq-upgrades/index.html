<p>A small team of tunneling experts&mdash;yes, the ones who brought you the Chunnel&mdash;are busy connecting Rally Farm Supply and Lingerie with CU's warren.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the board of directors has dispatched me to Sarasota to find No.2 pencils, which strikes me as a ploy to get me out of the office for a while.</p>
<p>Oh well. I'm enjoying it. Hot tubbing to start the day, wine to polish it off. Wonder if someone will buy Dave a new bike, preferably one that doesn't make him think he's one of the SuperFrenz. I'm tired of stopping at phone booths.</p>
