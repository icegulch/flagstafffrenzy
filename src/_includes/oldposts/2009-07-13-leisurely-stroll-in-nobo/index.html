<p>This weekend, I decided to try patching the Thule cargo box Adriana drove into our garage door at 40mph (while backing out).</p>
<p>McGuckins had some amazing apoxy that sealed not only the cracks but also my left ring and pinky fingers (call me "The Claw" from now on).</p>
<p>Now I just have to go to Super Rupair in North Boulder and replace the mangled roof-rack crossbar.</p>
<p>So, if you'd like to join me on this mission, with slight detours up some of the steeper ramparts in town, gather at Humanities @ 12p.  I'll be riding the truck.</p>
<h6>Kudos to Adriana</h6>
<p>True, I do talk smack about her above, but I'm still very proud:</p>

<p>This development now serves as a challenge to Dave's motto for us: "None of us is dumber than all of us."  What to do?</p>
