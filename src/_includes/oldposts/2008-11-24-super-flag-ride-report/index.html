  <p>Adriana and I took advantage of the continued mild fall weather today, pointing our skinny tires toward the tippy-top of Flagstaff.  Despite the occasional convoy of wanna-be race car drivers, we enjoyed a relatively quiet day in the saddle.</p>
<p>There wasn't much dancing on the pedals this afternoon, though.  The winds were at your back at one moment, down your throat the next.  Still, when you're climbing in a short-sleeve jersey in November, you really can't complain.</p>
<p>One thing Dave's noted in recent comments is the return of the dreaded sandpits, particularly in the hairpin corners.  Be careful when you're descending, folks.</p>
