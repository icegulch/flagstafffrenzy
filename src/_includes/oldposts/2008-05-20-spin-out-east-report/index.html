  <p>Me, myself, and I today... I did the 51st to Neva Loop, dropped in at the Rez to take a dip, was appalled at the amount of signage done up in Helvetica Black. It gets worse every year; <q>No Swimming Here,</q> <q>No Kayaking There,</q> <q>No Parking Between Here and There,</q> <q>No Sunbathing Over There By That Rock,</q> <q>No Music After 10PM,</q> <q>No Poetry Reading On Sundays.</q> Who the hell is in charge out there? Did James Dobson and the president of Singapore have a love child? And how did they get a job w/ Boulder Parks and Rec? Is this what Hell will look like? There... I feel better now.</p>

<p>I'm thinking it might be a nice change to spin a bit today... Neva? Baseline Rez? Marshall loop? Whatever... If you want to give it a go (or have any other routes in mind), e-mail or call me (2-2672). I'm thinking noon-ish.</p>

<p>Hey, boys!  Greetings from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/545g9h">Jurmala, Latvia</a>&mdash;a longtime resort town on the Baltic Sea!  Good to see Greg's taken the reigns and lifted this tripe of a blog out of the gutter!  Good show, man!</p>
<p>The above video includes some scenes from old town Riga and from an <q>open-air ethnographic museum</q> showcasing the Latvian culture of yore.  The folk music is from a group that was singing at said museum.</p>
<p>Overall, the trip's going well, but Adriana and I both agree that Latvia doesn't merit eight days. Oh well. We've biked once so far in London and once in Latvia. Haven't broken out our shorts at all; it's been rather cool.</p>
<p>Watching the <em>Giro d'Italia</em> live on t.v. now, so I can't complain.  Looking forward to getting back into the saddle again with y'all.  The more I travel, the more I'm convinced we live in one of the best spots in the world.</p>
