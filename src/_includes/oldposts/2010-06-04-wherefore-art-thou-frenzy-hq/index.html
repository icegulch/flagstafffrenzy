<p>It's been a while since we've flown the coup. Let's sneak out the back door, and ride uphill somewhere today. If you're game, gather at HUMN @ 12:10p.</p>
<p>By the way, iSean thinks he's figured out what the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/03/fraunhofer-developing-bike-helmets-and-other-products-that-sti/">source of the permanent odor</a> surrounding Dave is. We've always known Dave had a sulfurous personality, but this accounts for the effluvium that shadows him.</p>
<p>And this just in from Mark for K-No's eyes in particular:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And by the way, Tuesday was Mark's birthday, so wish him a happy one if you see him. I was supposed to come up with some kind of Photoshop mockery, but I just plain dropped the ball.</p>
<p>Sorry, Mark. I promise Dave and I will make it up to you soon.</p>
