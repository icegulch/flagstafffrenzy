<p>It's always fun to go to the new faculty fair.  It's kind of like when the new students move in.  Lots of expectations and excitement.  I enjoy the vibe, anyhow.</p>
<p>Did get out for a quick recovery ride today on Super-Flag.  Not sure how or why I convince myself that Super-Flag is a good place to recover, but I did manage to take it easy...I think.  Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Saw Herr Doktor Kinsman riding his mountain bike up near the dreaded 20% stretch.  He was looking fluid and strong, as ever.</p>
<p>As a total aside, looks like the Frenz failed in their quest to woo Favre out of retirement.  Too bad we haven't yet freed up Maloney's salary.  If we had, I think we could've <a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=4407157">sealed the deal</a>.  Seriously, I can't believe it!</p>
<p>Speaking of Maloney, don't miss his farewell ride on Neva tomorrow.  A bunch of folks intend on gathering at 11:30a @ Stadium Gate 5.  Should be fun!</p>
<h6>Mount Evans, Saturday, September 19th?</h6>
<p>We have five folks who can ride Mount Evans on Saturday the 19th, so let's put it on the calendar!</p>
<p>We should probably leave the 20th open too (if you can), in case there's one weekend day better than the other.</p>
