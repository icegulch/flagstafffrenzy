<p>After polling the regulars, I quickly ascertained that I was likely riding solo today.  So informed, I decided to forgo the TCOM rendezvous and head directly up Flag from my office&mdash;sorry if that dashed anyone's plans.</p>
<p>Knowing it was gonna be a wet one, I packed a spare of just about everything and shoved off.  Chautauqua and its environs are much greener than when I left, and the low clouds were reminiscent of some Hobbit scene.</p>
<p>Atop Flag, pea-soup fog lent a mystical air to the road, which was pleasantly devoid of tourist traffic.  The only problem was the humidity.  Had to take off my glasses for half the ride.  Not a bad problem to have, though, if you ask me.  Speaking of soup, I'm craving something warm.</p>
<p>Good to be back!</p>
