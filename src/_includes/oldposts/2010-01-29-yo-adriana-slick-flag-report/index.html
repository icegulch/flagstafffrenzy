<p>Speaking of J.D. Salinger, I almost forgot one of <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/01/26/favorite-openings">my favorite book openings</a> by another New Hampshire writer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice&mdash;not because of his voice, or because he was the smallest person I ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my motherâ€™s death, but because he is the reason I believe in God...</p>
<p>John Irving &ndash; <em>A Prayer for Owen Meany</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yay, <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/01/29/yo-adriana#comment-2434">Adriana passed</a> her Masters comps!! Congrats. It's time for some New Belgium beer.</p>
<p>Dave and I hit flag today, and I'd have to say conditions were borderline. The Dave Dicey-ness Scale (last calibrated in 1998 over at NIST) was pegged in the red.</p>
<p>Still, we made it home safely, and in truth, most of the road was bone-dry. It's just that the shady spots were still pure ice.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/iDog.jpg" /><br />iSean's <em>Colorado Daily</em> photo reminded Dave of something he couldn't articulate...until now. Behold iDog!!</div>
<p>Let the alterations to this photo continue!</p>
