  Cherryvale Loop Report

  <p>With Dave out of town, things fell apart. Kevin, aka. Powerful, went for a ride around the Cherryvale Loop at 11:45a.  I would've joined him, but I was in a meeting until 12:05p.</p>
<p>So, instead I called iSean and asked if he wanted to do the same route Kevin did.  He said "Sure" and we went on our merry way.</p>
<p>It was a little cooler than before because clouds were starting to build, and we even had a few raindrops refresh us on the latter part of the ride.  So, all in all, a great day!</p>
<p>Sorry we missed you, Powerful!</p>
