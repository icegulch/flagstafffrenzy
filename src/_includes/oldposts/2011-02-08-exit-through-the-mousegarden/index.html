That Steve... Always on the lookout for a bargain. Adriana snapped this pic of him trying to sneak a free ride on the West Virginia Hillbilly Flyer at Epcot yesterday. I know he's quick, but damn!, he didn't stand a chance. That train really <em>scoots.</em>
<p>Evidently the Disney security guys weren't real thrilled about him clomping through the begonias in his size thirteen Sebagos. They escorted him out of the park, and in this part of Florida, that's the same as being deported. Look for him to be back in Boulder by Wednesday.</p>
<p>Great day for Yak-Traxing up the Four Pines trail, eh? 2-2672</p>
