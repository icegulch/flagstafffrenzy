<p>The Frenz improvised their route today, switching from Fourmile Canyon to Poorman Loop&mdash;an excellent choice in hindsight!</p>
<p>Poorman Road must have been recently graded or packed down by the moisture from last weekend's snowfall.  Regardless of the "how", it was well-packed and fast.</p>
<p>Dave, Trunk Monkey (Greg's nickname), was on fire, making Greg <q>nervous and tense</q> all the way until the last incline, where he caught Dave looking over his left shoulder and passed him on the right.</p>
<p>In the post-ride interview, Trunk Monkey was rather curt, saying he was not only baffled by Greg's tactics but also by the new sobriquet Greg had chosen for him.
