  <p>Wow!  Greg hit Fourmile hard today, and he says Fourmile hit back, though I'd beg to differ (I had Greg with 42 punches to the road's 23).</p>
<p>Mr. Stauffer threw down an impressive 29:00 on Fourmile, eclipsing DU's 29:29 of a few years ago.  An ambulance had to be summoned to cart off Dave's ego, so he wasn't available for comment after his record was shattered.</p>
<p>The season is early still, so I expect Greg's time to come down precipitously.  The same goes for DU, who hasn't been stopping beside the road and playing dead, so that's a victory right there.</p>
<p>Greg's sure he can hit 27:00, but I'm thinking he can do better: 26:00 by fall.  The trick is not to go too hard at the start, and Stauffer says he did just that today.</p>
<p>I'm fired up by Greg's intensity!  Let the Frenzy fireworks begin!!</p>
