  <div class="center"><img src="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/c.jpeg" /><br />Today, Steve got schooled in the ways of cycling</div>
<p>Dave and the crew skipped town on me today, so I figured I'd be riding alone.  But, when I stepped out the door today, lo and behold, there was Brian Hutchison.</p>
<p>Now, I won't attribute any malicious intent to Mr. Hutchison&mdash;I'm sure he was just looking for some company on his lunch ride.  But, despite his innocent intentions, I had a feeling I was in for a painful day in the saddle.</p>
<p>I wasn't disappointed.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://vitamincottagecycling.com/v/archive/2008/04/29/4601.aspx">full cycling team kit</a> served notice that I was in for some suffering.  That wasn't all that worried me, though.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Hutchison was running a non-compact crankset.  What earthly cyclist rides Flag with those gears?!  He then informed me he was going <q>medium intensity</q> on this afternoon's ride: climbing the 10% grades exclusively in the big ring.  Of course, I think he was just trying to make me feel better; he was likely at <q>easy</q> intensity.</p>
<p>Anyhow, my hackles verily raised, I resigned myself to wheel-clinging, figuring it best to hang on for dear life.  I'd hate to see this guy's <q>high intensity</q> days.</p>
<p>Anyhow, as I lost contact on the third of <em>Three Easy Pieces</em>, I heard Phil and Paul saying, <q>Oooh, Bailey's dropped. He's got to be careful here.  He's got to ride within himself up to the summit.</q></p>
<p>Indeed, I felt a little like Jan Ullrich looking down at the pedals wondering where the power went.</p>
<p>Great ride, Brian!  Thanks for joining us.  Please feel free to tag along again during one of your <q>very easy</q> days.</p>
