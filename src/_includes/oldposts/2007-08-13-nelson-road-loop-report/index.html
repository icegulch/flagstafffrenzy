<p>There are two reasons I think I need to block out time on everyone's calendar for the Frenzy rides.</p>
<p>First, y'all seem burnt out from work.  That's no good.</p>
<p>Second, I need some folks to draft off!  During today's ride on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&geocode=&saddr=Colorado+Ave+%4040.008230,+-105.266810&daddr=Folsom+St+%4040.029170,+-105.263110+to:26th+St+%4040.051000,+-105.263270+to:N+Foothills+Hwy+%4040.144990,+-105.282160+to:Nelson+Rd+%4040.152380,+-105.206800+to:N+63rd+St+%4040.075910,+-105.206940+to:Jay+Rd+%4040.051000,+-105.263270+to:Folsom+St+%4040.029820,+-105.263130+to:40.008231,-105.266836&mrcr=7&mrsp=8&sz=19&mra=mi&sll=40.008205,-105.26668&sspn=0.000964,0.002511&ie=UTF8&ll=40.089104,-105.212631&spn=0.246371,0.6427&z=11&om=1">Nelson Loop</a>, I was faced with a constant 12-15mph HOT, HOT headwind and I had no one to sit on.  There were only three other folks out there, so couldn't latch on to any groups either.</p>
<p>As the wind direction plot above shows, the cursed breeze hit me head-on as I headed north on 36, shifted to backhand me as I spun east on Nelson Road, shifted again to kick me in the teeth as I noodled along 63rd, and sucker-punched me on Folsom as I limped south to campus.</p>
<p>To top it all off, I put too much powder in my energy drink and got some serious stomach complaints on the way back down Folsom.  Uhhhg!</p>
