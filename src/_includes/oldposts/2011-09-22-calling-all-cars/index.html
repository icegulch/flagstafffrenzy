<p>Really enjoyed the new flic "Drive". It's tense, violent, and highly stylized like "No Country" but it's not as lyrical. Still, my favorite this year. The soundtrack is great too.</p>
<p>Ever been talking to someone who's convinced they've met you before but they haven't and you're quite certain of it? I desperately tried to help someone extract herself from such a scenario last night, but my efforts were in vain.</p>
<p>I've probably done the same.</p>
<p>Cleanup in early October? It'd be a great way to see the colors and do some volunteer work.</p>
