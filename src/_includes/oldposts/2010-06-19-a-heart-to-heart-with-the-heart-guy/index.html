  <div class="center"><img src="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/heart.jpg" alt="plumbing" width="500" /><br />My cardiologist is working closely with engineers from British Petroleum to get me back in the hunt.</div>
<p>"She's a beauty, isn't she?"</p>
<p>I followed my cardiologist's gaze out his office window to the cherry red Alfa that sat in the parking lot below.</p>
<p>"Yeah, really sweet ride, Doc."</p>
<p>"You know they only made forty of them. Very rare beast. And you should see her on the Peak-to-Peak. Oh   my   God."</p>
<p>"Yeah, nice car, Doc. I'm wondering about this procedure you're going to do, though. I'm a little concerned about a few things."</p>
<p>I'd briefly pierced his reverie. He broke off his shameless slobbering over the car long enough to talk medicine.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah, your procedure. Piece of cake. Don't think twice about it. I've done a million of these. Well... four, actually. Enough to pay off the Chris Craft. Do you like mahogany? You should <i>see</i> this boat of mine. Amazing."</p>
<p>"On your website you said the angio-whatever-you-call-it would give me a forty percent increase in aerobic capacity."</p>
<p>"We have a website?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, and there's a graph there that shows before and after. It says that after the procedure I'll feel thirty years younger."</p>
<p>"Oh <i>that.</i> That's a rough estimate. Why the hell do you want to be thirty years younger, anyway? You'll have acne. Say, does that look like oil under my car?"</p>
<p>"No, I think it's just water from the sprinklers."</p>
<p>"Whew... Now, what were you saying?"</p>
<p>"Look, let's cut to the chase. I ride bikes with these young dudes who beat me up on a daily basis. I only want to go through with this if you can promise me I'll be back in their league."</p>
<p>"Holy crap! What, do I look like a miracle worker? Maybe you want Mother Theresa. Or a time machine, ha ha."</p>
<p>I could see his attention drifting back to the parking lot again. An elderly woman had just climbed into a battered white Montego parked behind the Alfa. She started the motor and I saw the reverse lights flash on.</p>
<p>"Uh oh..." My cardiologist was rising from his desk.</p>
<p>I heard her gun the engine a few times and saw a haze of mud-colored smoke belch from the tail pipe. The reverse lights blinked menacingly like the eyes of a dull, but very poisonous reptile.</p>
<p><i>"Oh no!"</i></p>
<p>The car rocked once.</p>
<p><i>"Oh God, please no!"</i></p>
<p>Rocked twice.</p>
<p><i>"No!"</i></p>
<p>And slammed its two full tons of pure Detroit venom backwards into the innocent, doe-eyed Alfa, which shuddered and crumpled pitifully like an empty soda can. The reverse lights went out, and the Montego lurched forward, out of the parking lot and onto Mapleton.</p>
<p>My doctor, wan and shaking, sank back into his chair. In a wavering voice that was barely audible, I heard him say, "Yeah, thirty years younger, I guarantee it. My receptionist will schedule it for Wednesday."</p>
<p>I can hardly wait.</p>
