  <p>So, after posting the South Boulder ride, having second thoughts and canceling it, I stepped outside to catch the bus, then&mdash;perhaps it was the gentle persuasion of the breeze on my shoulders&mdash;I suddenly decided I would saddle up and ride home in spite of the wind.  I just couldn't bring myself to wait for the bus, ride the bus, go home, catch the bus again, ride again, and walk back to my office.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if my mercurial mindset has ruined your day in any way.  I promise to make it up to you tomorrow with a punishing ride.</p>
