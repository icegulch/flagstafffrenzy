<p>It was a little brisk for shorts, but in the end it was good motivation for spinning, which is exactly what I did this afternoon.</p>
<p>Dave is probably stepping out the door as we speak. He's been bridled with meetings and talks, poor guy. Still, I secretly enjoy this time of year (when Dave's business ramps up and mine calms down). Schadenfreude?</p>
<p>Anyhow, the dirt on Boulder County's roads is still as hard as packed clay, kinda like Roland-Garros without the <a href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/11/09/with-a-book-to-sell-agassi-finally-comes-clean-on-drug-use.aspx">meth-man Agassi</a>. Coupled with the comfortable temps, you can't ask for better riding.</p>
<h6>Plumbing Report</h6>
<p>Over the past week and a half, I've been cleaning the pipes of this run-down shack. The broken links, missing photos and videos, and generalized chaos are no more&mdash;all except for the comments, which were chaotic anyway.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Bios, Routes, Gallery, and Videos pages are, insofar as I can tell, up-to-date, with the exception of iSean's forthcoming bio.</p>
<p>But, there's always a chance I've missed something. If, during your regular visits to the Frenzy archives [chuckle], you espy some errata or notice there's a gallery missing for which you have photos, please let me know.</p>
<p>After all, we're all about accuracy here at HQ.</p>
