  <p>Mr. Leary left his pugil stick at home and exhibited rather docile behavior toward the Frenz, making today's ride quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>Supposedly it's going to snow tonight, but given the bright sunshine, it's hard to fathom.  Indeed the clear skies seemed a cobalt skin stretched over the spirey marrow of the Front Range, beckoning the Frenz to camp in their moonlit ramparts.  Hmm, sounds like a good idea!</p>
<p>Thanks to Dave and Rob for joining, and even to Matt who got lost looking for the point of departure.</p>
