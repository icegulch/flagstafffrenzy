<p>Got out for our first hike of the season today: Lost Creek Wilderness. I'm sooo out of shape. Sigh.</p>
<p>I think it's about time for a fox/hound after work. At the very least, we should do a cruiser ride followed by beer. Who's in?</p>
<p>I think we should also do a Tour de France viewing party. We should also place two bets: top three places and doped riders (must be caught by the end of 2011).</p>
<p>That's it for the weekend edition.</p>
