<p>Great ride today!  Dave and I enjoyed the cool but comfy conditions, and were only held back from the tippy top by one pernicious snow drift.  Thanks, Dave!</p>
<h6>Dave and Zack's Sunday Ski Report</h6>
<blockquote>The Park was beautiful today. Z and I skied up to Loch Vale. I'm beat to a pulp tonight from countless falls but they were all from being a bumbling klutz, not from vapor lock or whatever.</blockquote>
<p>Though Adriana and I weren't nearly as ambitious, we skied up the Rollins Pass Road a ways yesterday.  Because it was Superbowl Sunday, all the snowmobilers were absent, so we had the trail to ourselves.  Quite good skiing, in fact!</p>
<p>Before skiing, we did our taxes.  It was a romantic Sunday.</p>
