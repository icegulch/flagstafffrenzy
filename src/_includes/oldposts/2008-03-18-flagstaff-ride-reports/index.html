  <p>Since SB is running on about four hours sleep - that's for the last three days - I'm<br>
tossing in some white noise of my own.</p>
<p>Flagstaff was primo yesterday and today. Plastered snow and thick fog yesterday,<br>
with a little snowpack on the wall. Today the road was pristine; the Boulder County<br>
Highway guys had cleared things beautifully and the sun had dried out the last of<br>
the moisture. The ride was about as pretty as it gets.</p>
<p>Greg went his own way, headed for a Chautauqua duathlon. I'm sure he had a good<br>
outing... hard to go wrong with weather like this!</p>
