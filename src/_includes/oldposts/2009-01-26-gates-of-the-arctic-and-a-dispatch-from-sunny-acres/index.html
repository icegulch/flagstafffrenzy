<p>I just dropped by the nursing home. It was time for the daily wet mop and they wanted visitors to step out for a bit. I told Steve I'd be right back, but I won't, not that it matters; in his state all things are ephemeral, and now is then and then was never. 
<p>Since he hurt his back, SB has become what his caregivers call a &quot;roiling vortex of need.&quot; I tried telling his nurse that he wasn't always like this, that he was young and vital once. She just giggled, and as she stuck the Post-It note on his forehead (&quot;Checked underwear Monday AM.. Check again Thursday&quot;), she said, &quot;That's what they <i>all</i> say.&quot;</p>
<p>I'm doing Flag at noon. Takers?</p>
