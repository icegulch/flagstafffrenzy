<p>It was sprinkling when I stepped out the door at noon, and things didn't look like they were going to get much better.  So, I decided to stay close to home and spin up Flag.</p>
<p>Near the top, I was reminded of Mount Washington in summer: fog, cool temps, and humid.  Indeed, I ended up having to take off my sunglasses because they kept fogging over.  I was psyched that I recently threw one of those cloth wipes for glasses in my under-the-seat pouch.</p>
<p>Brought (and used) a rain jacket and arm-warmers today.  Only 59&deg;F at the Mesa Lab currently.</p>
