  <p>Dave would be proud and jealous of us at the same time, for we had new blood join our ranks today: Hideo Kawanabe.</p>
<p>Much to Dave's chagrin, however, Hideo isn't the fluff newbie Dave's used to beating up on.  He's going to be a formidable adversary, the more so since I let him in on all Dave's "rookie tricks."  Anyhow, thanks for riding, Hideo!</p>
<p>Rob Leary, Mr. Mount Evans himself, also spun out east with us.  Temps were just perfect with nice cloud-cover to boot.  The fields are still green, but if this weather keeps up, all will soon be brown!</p>
<p>Once again, hope you're well Dave.  Kevin has promised not to write those riotously funny comments that he always posts, lest we add to your already impressive laundry-list of injuries.</p>
