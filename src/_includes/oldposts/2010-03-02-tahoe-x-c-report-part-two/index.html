<p>Hey Guys! I'm loving it out here in Tahoe!</p>
<p>This morning, the breakfast buffet at the Drifter's Lodge had those giant Belgian waffles, the ones with all the little wells filled with butter and brown sugar. Mmmm... I had about six or so of the buggers - with whipped cream and strawberry jam - even though I was still kind of stuffed from the All-U-Can-Eat rib special at Smitty's last night.</p>
<p>Man, Smitty's <i>really</i> rocks! Their ribs were served Southern Style, on a board with a cleaver and these bigass onion rings. The waiters told me I broke the house record for refills, but, hey!, who cares... I'm on vacation, right? I'm going back there tonight because they're doing a prawn-taco thing with home fries and cajun groat clusters. If I go easy on pizza at lunch later this afternoon, I should be able to singlehandedly bankrupt the place, hey hey.</p>
<p>Well, I gotta' run; I think I hear the ice cream cart coming up the alley. Think I could use a little Rocky Road to hold me over.</p>
<p>See ya' soon. Let's all do lunch when I get back!</p>
<p>Steve</p>
<p>PS,<br />I hear DU is riding Flag after his meeting this afternoon. Someone should keep the poor schmuck company; 2-2672</p>
