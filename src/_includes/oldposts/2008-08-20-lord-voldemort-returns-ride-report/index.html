<p>I'm back!  Prepare yourself for an overabundance of <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2008/08/19/orienting-new-people#comment-817">vacuous inanities</a>.</p>
<p>Dave's right (about something for a change): there's a hint of fall in the air!  Fourmile canyon had a gentle refreshing breeze, some leaves hinted at turning soon, and the light is slightly different, as Dave observed.  Can't wait.</p>
<p>Not much else to report.  Dave didn't show any visible signs of disgust with my rambling observations.  But, come to think of it, he did have earplugs in; either that or Dick Cheney was feeding him pat responses&mdash;a testament to Dave's inability to think or speak for himself.</p>
