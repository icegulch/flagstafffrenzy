<p>The FEMA guys just left. They think the sandbags around the ATLAS Building should hold, at least until midnight. If worse comes to worse, they've promised to airlift in a few palettes of bottled water and Pringles, so we're all set... After all, they did such a great job in N'Awlins.
<p>Berly Edwards joins the Frenzy Follies today. We're going to slog up Enchanted Mesa or maybe the switchbacks to Royal Arch. Don't think we'll need sunscreen.</p>
