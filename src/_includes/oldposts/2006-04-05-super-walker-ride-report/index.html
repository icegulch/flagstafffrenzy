<p>I suppose all of you would-be participants were shaving your legs last night, and that's why you skipped out.</p>
<p>Well, regardless, Terry and I enjoyed the extra hour of daylight while spitting dirt at Walker Ranch.  It was a real treat to watch Terry tear it up.  I mean, one minute I'd be descending right behind him, and the next he'd be a quarter mile ahead of me catching air on every bump.</p>
<p>In truth, I was only "right behind him" for a few seconds, as I'm a really granny on the descents.  Still, we both had perma-smiles plastered to our suncreen-lathered faces, all the while enjoying the single-track meadows and gurgling creek crossings.  We're going to ride it again soon.  Hope your legs are smooth, 'cuz ours are sore!!</p>
