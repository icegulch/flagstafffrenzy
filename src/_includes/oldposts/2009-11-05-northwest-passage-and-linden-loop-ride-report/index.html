An HD helmet cam for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/VHoldR-1200-VholdR-ContourHD-Camera/dp/B0026P4H6K">only $279</a>?!</div>
<p>What can I say? When it's 75F in early November, I'm happy to be outdoors. In truth, if it's just not rainy and 33F in November, I'm happy!</p>
<p>As I rolled out from campus (solo), I took a peek at Rob's car to make sure it hadn't been towed. He's in New Zealand, you see, and asked if I could keep an eye on it. A-OK, Rob!</p>
<p>The ride down 19th was unusually quiet. I didn't have to try to explain to motorists that "Dave just chases cars out of instinct. Sorry, I forgot his leash." And the usual excuses.</p>
<p>Yarmouth is now in great shape&mdash;the section near the new Holiday homes. Repaved with ample room for bikes.</p>
<p>Wagonwheel Gap Road, the Northwest Passage on-ramp, was also lovely. As a secluded little hollow, it's still rife with snow and thus refreshing air.</p>
<p>I decided to top off Northwest Passage with the upper lariat of Linden Loop, just to make sure my quads remembered the day.</p>
<p>On the final section of University, the winds picked up all of a sudden. Is something blowing in?</p>
<p>Hey, Dave: hope you enjoyed that pedicure. Did the trench foot clear up?</p>
