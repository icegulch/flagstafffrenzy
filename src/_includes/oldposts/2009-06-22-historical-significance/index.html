  <p>In Bailey's worst decision yet, he's given me editorial privileges to this sorry excuse for a blog. In keeping with DU's theme set on Friday, this week, we'll be looking at the makeup of the Frenz. What makes them tick? What ever could have happened to them as a child to make them the way they are now? Head trauma, lack of key enzymes, unresolved Oedipus Complexes... everything will be explored under the (shiny, semi-transparent) microscope of iSean.</p>
<p><del>In the meantime, Dave suggested heading north today and doing a spin out to Neva. Let's meet at ATLAS at 12:45 (I have a 2p meeting, hence the weird start time).</del></p>
<p>The veritable Mr. Leary joined today. He and I ended up doing a modified Boxing Boulder ride, putting me in right before my meeting.</p>
<p>Dave decided not to show, putting him squarely in my sights. Beware DU. Hell hath no fury like an iSean scorned.</p>
