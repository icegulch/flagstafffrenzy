<p>With the painful reminder of yesterday's pounding 13.3 mile run with Rob through the Indian Peaks still in my legs, I struggled to muster the courage to step out the door today.</p>
<p>It would've been all the easier to say "Screw it!" given that I forgot my jersey and water bottles as well.  Perhaps even the claps of thunder or careless foot- and car-traffic should have dissuaded me.</p>
<p>But today was a test, as I see it.  At first I resolved to make it up Baseline.  Then, I said "Ah, why not Flagstaff House?"  Upon reaching that goal, I told myself "Just make it to Crown Rock, then we'll be ahead of the game."</p>
<p>In the end, I rode up to the Amphitheater Road, proud that I didn't quit in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>Metaphorically speaking, when do you guys think one should just turn around?  Depends on the situation, I suppose?</p>
<p>As an aside, I forgot that Dave is out of town.  So, the long-awaited showdown QB competition didn't happen.  Dave has been traded to the Vikings.</p>
