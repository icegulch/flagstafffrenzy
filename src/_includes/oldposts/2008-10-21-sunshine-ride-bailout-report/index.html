  <p>Dave couldn't make it; Rob's on his honeymoon; and others are tied up.  Given this and the impending cold front, I thought it best to wait until I get home to run with my dogs.  Tomorrow might be a good day for a duathlon or duel.</p>
<p>Dave says it snowed on the 13th, which means two folks were winners in this year's <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/pollsarchive#polls-2-ans">first snowfall poll</a>.  Congrats!</p>
<h6>Beware: Screed Below!</h6>
<p>In other random news, why don't baseball relief pitchers have to make a quick transition into the game?  I think those switches should be more like hockey substitutions...no darn warm-up pitches!  Just run out there (don't walk!) and throw.</p>
