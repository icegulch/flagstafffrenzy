  <p>Like Steve Martin's character in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093886/">Roxanne</a>, I knew something was wrong with the air as soon as I stepped outside this morning.  And, as it so happens, my nose <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6rrdra">didn't deceive me </a>.</p>
<p>Just now, Noel sent me this note from the Emergency Manager at Environmental Health and Safety:</p>
<blockquote>[T]he smoke may cause minor lung and/or eye irritation, and may be a nuisance for individuals with existing medical conditions such as asthma. To minimize the effects of the smoke, keep windows and doors shut and <strong>remain indoors when possible</strong>.</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top:1.2em;">Ignoring common sense and basic health practices, Dave, Noel, and I strode up Flagstaff like a couple of cocksure peacocks (<a href="http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/C/consonance.htm">consonance</a>).</p>
<p>My throat was really dry the whole way, so I took several pulls off my water bottle.  But, Dave says that this is a <q>character-building</q> day ("It's actually good for you," he opined); of course, Dave isn't known for his sense of self-preservation....or his good character.</p>
<p>Dave's bike broke down once more, so Rob has found him a <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/765370039.html">manly new one</a> on Craigslist.</p>
