<p>So, as mentioned previously, our FAC begins at 6pm @ The Hungry Toad.</p>
<p>Before that, however, I will leave a trail for any interested hounds to follow. I'll start marking my route <a href="http://bit.ly/ler2sx">from dojo4</a>, let's say at the intersection of 17th and Spruce.</p>
<p>Hounds can gather wherever on campus (talk amongst yourselves) and leave right at 5pm.</p>
<p>This fox/hound will be pretty casual and thus won't stray far from the Toad vicinity. A real effort will be made to keep the trash talk lo-brow and distasteful.</p>
