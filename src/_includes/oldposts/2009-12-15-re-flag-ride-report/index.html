<p>Wow, the pack ice caking the streets that feed Chautauqua is melting fast, especially on 16th, 14th, and 9th. This is good news for Cryo-Frenz.</p>
<p>Today temps were such that a jersey and vest were sufficient to keep warm on the ascent. On the descent, you basically just needed to zip up (and perhaps throw on a hat, if you're a real creature of comfort like me).</p>
<p>Pretty sure I saw <a href="http://tomdanielson.com/">Tom Danielson</a> on his way down today. I was hoping he was doing laps so I'd get to watch him fly up, but apparently he was intimidated by my baggy tights and overall amateurish appearance.</p>
