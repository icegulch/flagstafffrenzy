  <p>Today, I reached the base of Flagstaff and 1) noticed the muddy trails, 2) didn't have a bike lock, and 3) saw no one, so I decided to bag <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/initiation_view.jpg">Initiation</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, I rode Flagstaff on the <q>truck</q> (my mountain bike turned commuter bike).  The nice thing was I could put all my cold weather descending gear in the bed of the <q>truck</q> (the milk crate on my bike rack).</p>
<p>It was a day Dave would've loved (he's in Cortez).  And though I didn't ride with my shirt off, I was down to just a short-sleeve, so he would've been proud.</p>
<p>No school tomorrow, so enjoy the long weekend!  I'm headed to some hot springs and to the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grsa/">Great Sand Dunes National Park</a> for some fun and training on the sandy steeps of the dunes.  Ciao!</p>
