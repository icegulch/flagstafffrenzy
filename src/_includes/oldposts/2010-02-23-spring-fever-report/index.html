This is what I miss about Northern New England.</div>
<p>The film negative and slide scanner I bought this past weekend has me on a scanning tear. It's made me a touch nostalgic.</p>
<p>What I've always found haunting yet magical about krummholtz (the small conifers one finds in alpine zones) is that they're at a human scale and thus seem sentient.</p>
<p>With the exception of the usual suspects, most sections of Flagstaff Road were in spectacular condition (for this time of year). Translation: there's still a hefty serving of sand but the lower section of tarmac is nearly ice free.</p>
<p>Missed my buddy Dave, tho. Poor guy's being tested like Job. His solution is compartmentalization, which largely boils down to riding hard uphill as often as possible. Good luck, bud!</p>
