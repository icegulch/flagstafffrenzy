  Julian's Sunday &quot;Couch&quot; Report

  <p>It was a bachelor weekend at the Bailey Ranch this weekend, and accordingly I sat around watching football and swilling beer. Julian completely forgot about the sitting around part of couch potato'ing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that my couch is composite carbon with a genuine leather cover, mine is made by Selle Italia. The pizza was being served by the folks at the aid stations. Today was of course the <a href="http://www.deercreekchallenge.com/">inaugural Deer Creek Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>I was very disappointed to learn that the beer would only be available at the end of the ride. I believe I was misled&mdash;I genuinely thought this was a pub crawl.</p>
<p>The ride itself (the century) was 106 miles with 12,741 elevation climbed and is touted by the sponsors as the toughest century ride in the US. I think it might be the toughest purely due to the pizza&mdash;I saw almost as much of it on the side of the road as I did in the boxes!</p>
<p>It was an interesting ride for me because my Garmin decided to play tricks with me and fail to report elevation accurately. As a result I was under the impression I had almost 4k feet of climbing still to do right up until I hit about 90 miles and realized that reality was just not possible given the remaining mileage and course.</p>
<p>The event itself was very well run and I would recommend it!</p>
<p>Now back to the beer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I shouldn't feel so bad about truly riding my couch this weekend. I mean, hey, I did go fetch the mail.</p>
