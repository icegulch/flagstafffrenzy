<p>After a 4:30am red eye flight, I arrived in San Fran with plenty of time to kill.  Luckily, my hotel agreed to hold onto some of my stuff.  I was more mobile for it.</p>
<p>To stay awake, I just started walking north, which is quite a workout given all the hills here.  Before dawn, I passed Lombard Street, crookedest street in the U.S., and several other landmarks.  No one was about, so I had the town to myself.</p>
<p>After some time, I found a breakfast joint (<em>Home Plate</em>), where I grabbed coffee and a bite.  From there, I wandered around looking for the bike rental place, whose whereabouts I vaguely remembered from looking at GMaps&mdash;yes, Sean, an iPhone would've saved me some meandering (still, I found my way by actually <em>talking</em> to people...imagine that?!).</p>
<p>After renting a bike, I headed through The Presidio, across the bridge, and toward the Marin Headlands.  Somehow I ended up on a hiking-only trail, but the NPS trail workers who spotted me were tremendously nice and pointed me toward the actual biking trails.</p>
<p>From there I passed through Sausalito, a wealthy town with a houseboat community (and snobby bike shop).  After several more rollers and onshore breezes, I ended up in my destination, Tiburon.  From Tib, I took the ferry back to town, jumped a streetcar, and arrived at my conference hotel in time for orientation.  Great day!</p>
<p>As a funny aside, I was a little worried that, given the constraints of trying to pack two small carry-on bags with clothes for 13,000 feet, the beach, and a "with-it" town, I would arrive at the conference somewhat of a rag-tag clown.</p>
<p>Ah, but these are the Arts and Humanities, and judging from the sartorial choices of my conference peers, I fit right in.  I even ironed my shirts!</p>
<p>As another aside, while at the Mauna Loa Observatory, I bumped into a Google engineer who, like me, was riding his wife's coattails at 13,000 feet in Hawaii.  It just so happens that he's working on a beta project called <a href="http://knol.google.com/k">Knol</a> aimed at higher education.  We're officially invited to test drive it and provide feedback.  Serendipitous, eh?!</p>
<p>See y'all soon!  Go Sox!!</p>
