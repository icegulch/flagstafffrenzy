  <p>Well, those leeches really do drain you!  Dave said he just followed the phlegm trail up Flag.  Yuck!</p>
<p>Despite the ever-present sand on the road, conditions were largely dry and tacky.  The descent is hard, in terms of choosing the right hand-warmer: gloves or mittens.</p>
<p>Today, I chose the latter, and wasn't thrilled about the lack of brake-gripping.  They're better for mountain or cruiser bikes.  Gloves (of the full-fingered variety) are better-suited to road bikes.  Unfortunately for me, I could only find my cut-off (summer) gloves, which I wore on the ascent.</p>
<p>Anyhow, more important matters need to be discussed!  I'm thinking about a Frenzy overnight ski/snowshoe the weekend of February 23-24 in the Indian Peaks.  Hopefully no sub-zero temps this year.  Who's in?</p>
