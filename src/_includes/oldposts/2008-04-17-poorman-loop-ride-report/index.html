  <p>Rob is back from Columbia!  Check out his <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mediaguy99/BogotaAndTheSaltCathedral/photo#s5190309760411300434">trip photos</a>!</p>
<p>He joined Adriana and me on Poorman Loop this afternoon.  Mr. Leary was smarter than us too, because he rode a mountain bike rather than a road bike.</p>
<p>Conditions on Poorman Road were sloppy&mdash;the top layer of "road" consisted of a half-inch to inch of milkshake mud while the bottom layer was fairly hard-packed dirt.  If the underlayer had been any mushier, Adriana and I wouldn't have been able to make it up.  Needless to say, Rob's "John Deere" ate up the mud like hungry beast.</p>
<p>Now we gotta clean our bikes again, darn it!</p>
<p>Shout out to Dave, who's undergoing two veinograms today.  Positive thoughts your way, bud!</p>
