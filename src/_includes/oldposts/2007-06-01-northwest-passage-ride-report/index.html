  Northwest Passage Ride Report

  <p>We conquered the dreaded <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/routes#northwest">Northwest Passage</a> today without the use of banned substances.  Actually, that's a little bit misleading, as rumor has it Kevin's been working with Ricardo Ricco's <em>preparatore</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
RiccÃ² also uses the services of controversial masseur Roberto Pregnolato who was Pantani's soigneur. Pregnolato was found guilty in possession of drugs and trying to get rid of them during the <em>blitz</em> at the Giro in 2001. <q>He's not my preparatore (trainer), he only gives me massage sometimes; he's from Modena and he's a good masseur,</q> Ricky acknowledges. [<a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/road/2007/giro07/?id=/riders/2007/interviews/riccardo_ricco_giro07">CyclingNews</a>]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Enough with the rumors, though.  Everyone should wish Mark a Happy Birthday, as tomorrow is his big day!</p>
<h6>Special Friday Announcement</h6>
<p>Next Wednesday at 8am sharp, we'll be joining Paula Vaughan on her <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~pjsrun/wsb/html/view.cgi-home.html-.html">run from Boulder to Michigan</a>, so contact me if you're interested in joining (for the first few miles, of course).</p>
