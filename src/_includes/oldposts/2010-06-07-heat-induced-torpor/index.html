<p>Dave's going nuclear today, which means I'll be keeping a safe distance from him for the rest of the week, wearing my gamma suit for extra assurance.</p>
<p>This quick transition from 70s to 90s has a terrible effect on yours truly. I develop spot narcolepsy. Indeed, it struck twice this weekend while I was lying on my couch.</p>
<h6>Torpor Report</h6>
<p>Adriana and I picked up the slack in the wake of Dave's absence this afternoon, despite the 88&deg;F temps and oppressive heat. I think my lungs are four shades darker too, for I could actually <em>feel</em> the pollution collecting in my throat.</p>
<p>The heat seems to have absconded with "Fleeting Falls" too&mdash;the seasonal falls one can see in Gregory Canyon from the flat stretch of Flag just below the Amphitheater Road junction.</p>

<p>I was curious as to how IE6 users would be received on YouTube now that they've stopped supporting that flavor of Microsoft's browser. I think <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/youtube-ie6.png">they did a good job</a> of not outright kicking IE6 users out, suggesting instead that they upgrade to get the best experience. Your thoughts or opinions?</p>
