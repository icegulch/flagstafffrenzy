  <p>Dave was joined by his friends today as he slogged up his favorite hill for the<br>
700th time. It was great having the cooler full of drinks and goodies right there<br>
under the flagpole, and the professional photographer was an especially nice touch<br>
(gallery coming soon!). Everyone loved their commemorative T-shirts. In spite of a<br>
few notable no-shows and a P.A. system that cut out right in the middle of<br>
&quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; it was a picture perfect afternoon. Congratulations to Dave<br>
and Frenz on another successful 100,000+ vertical feet! Oh... and April Fool,<br>
Bailey!</p>
