<p>Hot on the heels of his recent best seller, "Ambassadors in Pinstripes," Tom Zeiler starts field work this week for his next hard-hiting tome, "Simpletons in Spandex." 
<p>The book, a full-frontal view of intelligent design's fatal defects, examines how two thought-free male subjects - we'll call them Steve and Dave - create and inhabit a delicate fantasy world in which they are athletic, smart, and well-liked.</p>
<p>Using Hunter Thompson's &quot;Hell's Angels&quot; as a model, Dr. Zeiler intends to &quot;embed&quot; himself with his subjects over the coming months, hoping to glean enough useful material to finish the book before the Frenz' manifest shortcomings begin to rub off.</p>
<p>We wish him luck.</p>
<p>And this just in... Let's all raise a glass to <strong>Adriana Raudzens Bailey</strong> who just received an <strong>NSF fellowship</strong>. Shazam! As if it wasn't enough she could ride like the wind.</p>
<p>No me today; I'm hoofing. And Steve is meeting-bound. Go play.</p>
