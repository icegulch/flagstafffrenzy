<p>What a nice stroll out in the country today!  Judging from the comments below, Dave wasn't happy that I sped ahead...but I had to water the bushes, so to speak.  That's the only thing that motivated my frantic pedalling.  Otherwise, I'm sure I would've wilted under the gear-mashing pressure!</p>
<p>Today was the return of the camera to our rides too.  I was kind of hankering for some pics of our rides, especially since it's getting so nice outside.  The creeks are actually sounding like creeks again, and the valleys are getting lush...for Colorado.  Unfortunately, Greg was so far ahead that we didn't get any shots of him.  Next time.</p>
