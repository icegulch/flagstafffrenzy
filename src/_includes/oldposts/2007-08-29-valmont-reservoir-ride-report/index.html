  <p>One of the best showings in weeks!  Thanks to Matt, Greg, Adriana, and Eric for joining us, especially Eric, who joined us for the first time by my count.  We even crossed paths with Kevin, who had decided to go his own way.</p>
<p>Matt and Greg dropped us three stragglers, duking it out on the rolling roads east of campus.  According to Mr. Burton, <q>Greg's one fast dude.</q></p>
<p>Eric has threatened to join us again, which will hopefully bolster the number of cat-calls we get from businesswomen&mdash;there's been a noticeable decline since Dave stopped riding (shirtless).  Indeed, I'm tired of people throwing rotten tomatoes at us.</p>
