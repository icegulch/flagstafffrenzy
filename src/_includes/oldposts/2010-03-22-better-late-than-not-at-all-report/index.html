  <p>I don't know how many times I've said <i>this is as good as it gets</i> over handlebars. Coupla' hundred? I know the logic is faulty, but there you have it... and today was no exception. Steve, Greg, and I had a great time on Flag this afternoon, making a major dent in the Lost Gulch climb as we savored the sweet admixture of deep snow, clean pavement, and balmy temps... Springtime on Flagstaff; wish we could bottle it!</p>
