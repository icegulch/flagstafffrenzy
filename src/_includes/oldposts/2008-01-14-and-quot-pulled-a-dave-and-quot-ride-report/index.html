<p>Somehow I managed to get tied up after today's meeting and thus missed the ride out east.  I don't think anyone else intended on joining me, so instead I "pulled a Dave."</p>
<p>For those of you not hip to the idiosyncrasies of our very own DU, it must be understood that, like monarch butterflies, Dave has some kind of internal, geo/helio-centric compass guiding his actions.</p>
<p>Usually, someone who's guided by "other forces" or "voices" is deemed nutso in our society.  Not among The Frenz.</p>
<p>You see, Dave naturally gravitates to Flagstaff Mountain when left to his own devices...or in his case, vices.  So, today, I decided to listen to Dave's voices and ride that familiar landmark.  Good fun, despite the dangers presented by the clueless, inattentive masses that have swooped back down on campus.</p>
<p>Very happy to <a href="http://flagstafffrenzy.blogspot.com/2008/01/theyre-backflee-campus-neva-ride.html#c647326607377942234">hear</a> that my lovely wife is feeling well enough to go trail running again.  Hopefully she'll join us on our next YakTrax-inspired duathlon.  Let it snow!</p>
