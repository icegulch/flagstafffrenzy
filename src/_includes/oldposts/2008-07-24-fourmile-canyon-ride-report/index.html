  <h6>Dave's Delightful Day in the Saddle</h6>
<blockquote><p>After I last saw you (and after having had my second flat), Dr. No pulled alongside me. We rode up to the gate together, then he aimed for SuperFlag, and I headed back down, being mostly out of time by now.</p>
<p>Halfway down, I snapped another spoke (front wheel) and was riding with a bad case of the wobbles when I had my 3rd flat (front wheel) of the day. I was out of tubes, so I decided to ride it back to the office on the rim, i. e., to-hell-with-it. Noel caught up w/ me back on Baseline and rode alongside me for a bit, but I think the smell of burning rubber from my front wheel really got to him. He offered me a spare tube, but I swear, by this point the idea of changing one more flat gave me the jeebies.</p>
<p>Sheesh.</p></blockquote>
<h6>Mr. Burton chimes in from Florida:</h6>
<blockquote>
As part of the Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API)  
course I took a ride in the pressure chamber. The air is gradually  
sucked out of this chamber until the air is the same thickness (thin- 
ness?) as it is at 25,000' above sea level.<br /><br />

We start out with our oxygen masks on. As part of the training we  
take the masks off and experience hypoxia, which is a lack of oxygen  
to the brain. The effects are dizziness, lack of motor skills,  
euphoria, and a light-headed feeling&mdash;much like being drunk. We play  
'Pensacola Paddy-Cake' to test our abilities.<br /><br />
I'm referred to as "number 11" in the video because I'm sitting in  
seat 11. The dude playing with the shapes toy is the other Air Force  
student in my class.<br /><br />
