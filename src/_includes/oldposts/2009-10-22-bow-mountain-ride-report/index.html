<p>Dave joined me on today's revival ride. No, no tents involved, just dusting off an old route.</p>
<p>A few things have changed on Bow Mountain too: new homes, more "private road" signage, and lots of traffic. What do all these McMansion owners do?</p>
<p>In any event, we were glad not to see a "private road" sign at the tippy top, where <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2007/04/20/bow-mountain-blood-drive-report">Greg impressed us all</a> by climbing the strip of Roubaix Rubble, aka "Stauffer Way."</p>
<p>Otherwise, the familiar winter sandtraps are forming on the roads again&mdash;the result of all the sanding from these early season storms. You just have to pick your lines more carefully, that's all.</p>
<p>Greg, I was thinking about actually doing that "narrow road" ride from Sunshine Canyon to Lefthand Canyon over Fall Break (when the students and faculty are away). Can you spare two hours?</p>
<p>Other takers?  Will likely entail a mountain bike.</p>
