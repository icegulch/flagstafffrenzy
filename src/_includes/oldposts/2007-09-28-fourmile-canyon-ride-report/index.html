  Fourmile Canyon Ride Report
</h1>
<time>September 28, 2007</time>
<article>
  <p>On the way up Fourmile Canyon today, some descending maniac in a 2007 Buffalo Bicycle Classic jersey was yelling at us to be on time next time.  What's up with that?!</p>
<p>He must not have had someone stop by his office at 11:52a to take back his brand new MacBook Pro because it's defective...if he did, he'd understand.  It was very sad to see it go away....</p>
<p>Anyhow, three other 2007 BBC jersey wearers&mdash;Matt, Adriana, and Steve&mdash;pedaled up the canyon this afternoon, wired with HRMs recording their every vital sign.  Hearts were aflutter!</p>
<h6>Special Announcement</h6>
<p>Matt's last rides will be next Monday and next Wednesday.  On Monday, he's requested Linden Loop, as his front d√©railleur is not staying engaged, so it's "easier" to go uphill (so he says).</p>
<p>On Wednesday, his last day, we of course have to ride Flagstaff, and I hope you'll all cancel meetings scheduled for noon now.  It'll be a good time!</p>
