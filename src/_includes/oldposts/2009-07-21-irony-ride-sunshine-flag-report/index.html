  <p>The shroud of fog and 55&deg;F temps were enough to deter the fair weather Frenz.  Or, more likely, they had work to do.  As usual, I had blocked the lunch hour off.</p>
<p>Dave had to leave early today to tend to his pooch Georgie, who just had a cyst removed.  Please think positive thoughts for her.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the ride this noon-hour was fantastic. No rain, just cool vapors.  I chose Flag just in case it did rain&mdash;quick escape.  It felt more like mid-May than mid-July, and I half expected to see a light coat of snow on the slopes.</p>
<p>Could it be that I'm pining for fall/winter already?  Yesterday's hailstorm and relentless thunder was something else, huh?</p>
<p>Any Arvada or Broomfield residents get severe weather?</p>
