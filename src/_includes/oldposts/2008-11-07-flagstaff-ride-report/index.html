  <p>Too bad I didn't have a camera!  On the return flight to campus, I saw the grounds crew raking leaves.  The winds are gusting to 40mph, and these poor folks are raking leaves!  Reminded me of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus">Camus tale</a>.</p>
<p>The ride was blustery, even for Flagstaff!  Still, I was astounded by the number of cyclists I saw today.  Usually, everyone's scared away from the mountains at the first sign of bad weather.  Apparently, wind doesn't count.</p>
<p>I'm really digging the closed gate!  Makes the Amphitheater Road our very own <em>sanctum sanctorum</em>.  The more so today since Dave's off fishing, Rob's sick, and Greg/K-No are probably in a fun Friday meeting.</p>  
<p>Since I was alone, I didn't have to worry about practicing <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/student/student_life/article5102661.ece">good manners</a>.  Thank goodness.</p>
<p>My dad arrives tonight, and so I'll be on vacation on Monday and Tuesday.  I may just try to sneak out for a ride, so stay tuned.  I'll get a new poll up today too.  Have a great weekend, all!</p>
<h6>Dennis's Sendoff Ride</h6>
<p>Dennis has identified Thursday next week as a possible Neva Loop Sendoff Ride, in view of his looming retirement.  Hopefully a number of you lurkers will come out of the woodwork for this good cause!</p>
