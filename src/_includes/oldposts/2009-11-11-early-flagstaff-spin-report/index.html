<p>Unreal. Is it November?</p>
<p>Wonderful weather this afternoon&mdash;even the sandpits lining the hairpins weren't so bad. After a chilly commute to work, I showed up overdressed for sure.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Dave, Greg, and I noodled up at an amicable pace, and despite the efforts of unfriendly fellow cyclists bent on souring everyone's mood, our spirits lifted at every turn.</p>
<p>In unrelated news, I just found out, after buying more storage from them, that <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/more-extra-storage-for-less.html">Google has upped their limits</a>; in fact, they did so the day after I bought more space for my personal Picasa account.</p>
<p>Not to worry, however, as they honored the new limits on existing accounts. So, instead of getting 10GB for $20/year, I'm getting 80GB (+1GB included with the free account). Heck, I could upload all my raw files and still not tickle 3% of my capacity.</p>

<p>They haven't upped free account storage either (still 1GB), so it's not like I'm wasting those $20. I wonder what this portends, however, as there's talk of a forthcoming service called <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-docs-slowly-morphing-into-google.html">GDrive</a>.</p>
