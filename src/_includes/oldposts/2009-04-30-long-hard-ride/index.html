  <p>I have plans today, so I'm assigning you all the hardest ride you can think of.  There will be blood, so I anxiously await your reports.</p>
<p>If you don't feel up to the assigned ride, call Dave for the marshmallow route.</p>
<h6>Congrats to Noel Lenski, 2009 Guggenheim Fellowship Winner!!!!</h6>
<p>Usually, when <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/TJUjU-_DxP4I7oqlDdT9_g?feat=directlink">Frenz receive awards</a>, it's not something to celebrate.  But this one calls for a round of applause!  From <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/insidecu/editions/2009/4-28/awardskudos.html">InsideCU</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Noel Lenski awarded Guggenheim Foundation 2009 Fellowship</strong></p>
<p>Noel Lenski, associate professor of classics, received a 2009 Guggenheim Fellowship for his publication, â€œA history of slavery in late antiquity.â€ Each year the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation chooses honorees from the United States and Canada. This year 180 artists, scientists and scholars received fellowships. The recipients were chosen from almost 3,000 applicants and announced on April 8. Guggenheim Fellows are appointed on the basis of stellar achievement and exceptional promise for continued accomplishment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Way to go, Noel!</p>
