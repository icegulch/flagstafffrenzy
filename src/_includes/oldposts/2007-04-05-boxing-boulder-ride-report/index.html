<p>All kinds of challenges on today's <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/boxing_boulder.gif">Boxing Boulder</a> ride.</p>
<p>First, Mr. Burton thought his legs were sapped from a long mountain bike ride yesterday afternoon.  As it turned out, his rear breaks were rubbing (bad!).</p>
<p>Mr. Notheis is still repairing his road bike, so he decided to ride his new Marin instead.  Fortunately for us, the upright position of the Marin made Kevin a great person to ride behind, but he had double the workout we did.</p>
<p>One thing's for certain, we all envied Greg's &aelig;ro bars.  The winds were relentless, and we even had a Frenzy first (in my recollection): rain drops.  Truly mixed bag today!</p>
