<p>Greg, Rob and I had a nice ride up Poorman today.  Matt would have come along but a foot issue relegated him to the pool.  The sun hid behind the clouds for most of the ride, so it was a little cool at times.  The scenery was great, though, as all the rain has made everything lush and green in the canyons.  And aside from a few washboardy sections, Poorman Road was in good shape.</p>
