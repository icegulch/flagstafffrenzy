Just in time for Valentine's Day, give that special someone Steve Bailey's super new volume on climbing the corporate slagheap. In his superbly-written book, Bailey shares his secrets to success in a way that even the most obtuse among us can grasp. As Dave Underwood says, "After reading Steve's book, I feel ready to whack the organizational biscuit with one hand tied behind my back. And as soon as I get over these suicidal tendencies and my therapist says it's okay to be around untrained people again, that's just what I intend to do. Thank you, Steve Bailey!"
