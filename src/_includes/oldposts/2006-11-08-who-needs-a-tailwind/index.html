<p>Ouch...the wind was biting hard today up on Poorman.  Not a cold wind either!!  I had that stinging sweat in my eyes&mdash;you know the one that tells you "Hey, Dummy, drink more water!"</p>
<p>We were graced with the presence of the Chair of Classics who deigned to share the same road with us.  Normally those Classics guys wouldn't give you the time of day, but today was different.  Maybe it was the <em>Z&eacute;phyros</em> cascading down from Mt. Olympus.</p>
<p>Seriously, thanks to Noel, Dave, and Kevin for making the Chinook bearable!</p>
