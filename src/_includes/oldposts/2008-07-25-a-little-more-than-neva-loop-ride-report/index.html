  <p>Wow!  Big ride today.  Great group too!  Turns out Dave flunked his InDesign course last week and had to take a remedial course this week.  Slacker!</p>
<p>Anyhow, Julian joined Rob and me on a little Lefthand Canyon excursion.  Hearing about Dennis's new bike and seeing Julian's definitely makes me want to get a new ride.  I like the Cannondale and would still use it as a winter bike, but a nice new light ride would be swell.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks for riding today, guys!  Have a good weekend.</p>
