  <p>Well, we weren't able to run through thigh-deep snow, but Dave and I still had fun pedaling over to Settler's Park, running around the Red Rock fins, and then scrambling up to the top of Anemone Hill.</p>
<p>The telescoping grades of the "trails" are a real bear; in fact, it feels a lot like time-trialling on a bike, as there are no resting points.  Man, some of those trails require the use of all four paws.</p>
<p>Here's hoping we get a big blizzard this weekend!  But, at the same time, here's hoping Greg's parents are able to make it here safely!!</p>
