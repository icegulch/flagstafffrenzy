<p>Dave and I proved today that you can celebrate someone else's birthday in their absence and still have a blast.</p>
<p>Indeed, poor Kev was undoubtedly tied up in some IdM meeting while DU and I noodled up Flagstaff.  Interesting weather too.</p>
<p>The temperature seemed to be dropping about a degree every 10 minutes and the clouds were rolling in, so much so that we could smell Greeley upon returning to The Hill.</p>
<p>We both felt good in the crisp conditions. Dave had an engaging discussion with his imaginary friend Perley, or "Twinkle Toes" as he calls him.  Maybe he was just cold....</p>
