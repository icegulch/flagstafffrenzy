  <p>Oops...I've been slackin' lately as concerns posting rides <em>before</em> we actually ride.  My apologies.  Thanks to heads-up play by Mr. Burton and Mr. Underwood, a ride was arranged for Valmont Reservoir.  In spite of the lenticular clouds which suggested high winds aloft, we were able to do this ride out east in great conditions: sun, temps in the 50s, and only gentle winds.  Tomorrow promises more of the same.  Perhaps it's time we hit Sunshine....</p>
