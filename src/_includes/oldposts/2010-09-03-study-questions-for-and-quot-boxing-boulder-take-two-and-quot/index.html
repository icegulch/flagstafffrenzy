  <div class="center"><img src="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/mb.jpg" alt="report" width="350" /><br />Remember: there are no right or wrong answers... 
though, unbelievably, you'll probably still get an "F."</div>
<p>1. When you read <a href="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2007/03/08/boxing-boulder-take-2">"Boxing Boulder, Take Two"</a>, it becomes apparent that Matthew has tried before to lure female riders "into the mix." Has he been successful? Why not? Please quit laughing.
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>What the hell does &quot;into the mix&quot; mean, anyway? Would <i> you</i> want to be in Matthew's &quot;mix?&quot; You look pale. Are you feeling ill?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matthew has a ready excuse for being destroyed like a cheap plastic trinket by Greg. Is his excuse valid? Have you heard it before? How many times? (You can round off to the nearest hundred if you'd like.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some scholars believe Matthew Burton is a <i>nom de plume</i> for Gomer Pyle. Does this seem plausible? (Yes, that's correct; the Pope <i>is</i> Catholic.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After writing this story, Matt went on to become an Air Force pilot. Does this worry you? Are you moving to Canada with the rest of us?</p>
</li>
