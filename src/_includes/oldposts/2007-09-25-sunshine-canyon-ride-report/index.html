  <p>Now this is biking weather!</p>
<p>Dave led the way today, setting a grueling pace in the cool, dry, thin air of Sunshine Canyon.  Rob was right: Dave's thickened blood is definitely carrying more oxygen to his legs...but I would add that it doesn't seem to be getting to his head!</p>
<p>Matt has laid down his arms, it would seem, counting down the days 'til his move to Alabama.  Still, the youngster soldiered up to Poorman Road, which, lest we forget, is not what the average Joe does for lunch.</p>
<p>Rob and I hit the nasty gradients above Poorman, surviving a not-so-ferocious dog encounter and enjoying sparkling views of the Indian Peaks, which saw some flurries yesterday.</p>
<p>Great ride!</p>
