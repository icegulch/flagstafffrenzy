<p>Though Matt was submarined by a pernicious stomach ailment and Greg and Kevin were sidelined by ill-timed meetings, a hale and light-hearted group of Frenz still gathered on the flanks of Bow Mountain for a perfect-weather ride.</p>
<p>Adriana, Dave, and Steve avoided the planned Linden Loop Ride, opting instead to zig-zag their way up to the start of the <em>Paris-Roubaix</em> portion of pavement on Bow Mountain.  With work tugging them back to campus, they turned around before attacking the pav&eacute; sector.</p>
<p>Lots of traffic on the past few lunchtime rides.  That always surprises me.  Still, 4th Avenue was a pleasure for humans and deer&mdash;they seem to have taken up residence in the upscale Boulder borough.</p>
<p>Matt's promised to join us on Friday, so set that day aside!</p>
