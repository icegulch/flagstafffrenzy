<p>Fun ride today.  I'm sweating profusely again, which means it's summer or thereabouts.  Despite the heat, Rob, Dave, and I encircled our fair town. Poor Dave got a flat along the way&mdash;or perhaps he's been keeping his tire pressure even lower than the normal 15psi.</p>
<p>Construction has once again taken over many of Boulder County's roads, rendering the stretch on 75th between 63rd and Jay frustrating due to long wait times.  Because it's one-way, there's a certain pressure that goes with being a cyclist; no one wants to be the guy who holds up the traffic waiting on the other side.  Especially with <a href="http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2008/may/22/larimer-sheriff-singles-out-boulder-cyclists/">Sherrif Rosco P. Coltrane</a> patrolling our streets.</p>
