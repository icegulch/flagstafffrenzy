  <p>Today, there was a hint of not-so-sucky weather in the air.  The breeze was only moderate and the temps were in the low 40s, so definitely an improvement.</p>
<p>Despite not having any water, I felt good for the first time in a while.  No phlegm, surprisingly.</p>
<p>The same can't be said for Dave who tried shadowing some guy with an army backpack on a cross-bike, then tried to haul in two "guys" (who turned out to be ladies chit-chatting).  After these efforts, he felt whoozie on the way down, fighting off stars and tweety birds.</p>
<p>How was that 1:15p appointment, Dave-O?</p>
