<p>The weather's about to take a turn for the worse, but you'd never know it from conditions today. We're also going to lose an hour of daylight tomorrow, which means I need to make sure all my bike lights are in working order.</p>
<p>But, no matter how bad the conditions on our brumal bike commutes around Boulder, nothing compares to the perils of scaling transmission towers&mdash;free-climbing no less!</p>
<p>Dave and I have been talking about doing another FAC at the West End Brewery either the week before or the week of fall break, so stay tuned. Hope you can make it!</p>
