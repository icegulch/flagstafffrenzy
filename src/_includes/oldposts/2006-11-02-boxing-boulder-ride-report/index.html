  <p>Slim pickins out there today too.  At least Kevin made it.  Mr. Burton text-messaged us from DIA, where he's stuck at the terminal, to express his regrets for not making it.  Was chillier than the JeffCo Airport led me to believe&mdash;maybe 42&deg;.  Rob has put in a request for a run tomorrow, so I may end up posting his requested route and a bike ride route too.  Extra credit for those who do both!</p>
