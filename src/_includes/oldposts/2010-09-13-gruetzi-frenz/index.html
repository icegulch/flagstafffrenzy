  <div class="center"><img src="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/swiss-brigade.jpg" /><br />Steve's "holiday" was in fact a (successful) genealogy hunt. Behold! The Frenzy's Swiss Brigade.</div>
<p>That's right, folks. HQ dispatched me on a mission to reconnect with our Swiss lineage, and I was happy to find that we have Frenz abroad.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of meeting with the founder of the Frenzy's Swiss Brigade, Heinrich "Heinie" Unterholtz, who regaled me with stories of the days of yore, like when Heinie triggered an avalanche on his sidekick Stefan "Kleine KÃ¤se" BeilÃ¯. Different continent, same shenanigans, what can I say?</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/kleine-kase.jpg" /><br />The Swiss Brigade of course had their own Frenzy gang sign</div>
<p>It was an honor to learn some of the Swiss Brigade's customs, like their gang sign (used during raucous reunions and abend's at the pub alike). Other customs, like the cycle-self-arrest technique used on steep slopes in winter, were less familiar but have given the elders at HQ ideas.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/swiss-train.jpg" /><br />Steve was allowed to drive the Swiss Brigade's shuttle train</div>
<p>Likewise, the Swiss Brigade's shuttle service struck a chord with <i>Tour de Frenz</i> advocates. And driving the "shuttle" was a real hoot.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/no-high-heels.jpg" /><br />What's a girl like me supposed to do when hiking in Switzerland?</div>
<p>While I'm all for accepting socio-cultural differences, I was a little miffed by some of the strange rules the Swiss Brigade had adopted. No high heels on wanderwegs?! I'm drafting a letter to the Frenz Against Undo Xenophobia (FAUX).</p>
