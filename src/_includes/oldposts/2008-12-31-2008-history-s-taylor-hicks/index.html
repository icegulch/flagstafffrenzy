<p>Happy New Year to all of our Frenzy readers from around the globe! Here's hoping you both have a fabulous 2009 and that the warden lets you guys back into the weight room next year. We still think you got a crappy deal. Â  
<p>What would the new year be without a reflective look back at the previous year's highlights? So before we put on the funny hats and start drinking 'til we turn cubist, let's take a moment to recap 2008's greatest hits. Here they are, in chronological order:</p>
<p>That was easy. Thank God history grades on a curve... it's our only hope.</p>
<p>I need to stay close to HQ today, so I'll be hitting Flag again, with maybe a little SuperFlag tacked on. Telecom at noon?</p>
<p>I'm out Friday. SB would like you all to break up into small groups and discuss ways to be more productive. Â Â</p>
<p>Be safe, Frenz!</p></p>
