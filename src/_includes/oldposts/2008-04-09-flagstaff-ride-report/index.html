  Flagstaff Ride Report

  <p>For the third day in a row, I rode Flagstaff at lunch.  I was joined for the first section by Dave, but he had to split for a 1p presentation.  I think "The Hole" pretty much constitutes a Flagstaff ride by itself.</p>
<p>Given my Flagstaff hat-trick, I might as well go for broke and do it tomorrow and Friday&mdash;though the weather tomorrow might present a challenge.  I suppose I can always do a duathlon.  Hope you can join.</p>

<p>In-between hole 14 and the big sandtrap, Matt filed this report from Pensacola, FL:</p>
<blockquote>I'm officially slated to start flight screening in Pueblo on 25 April and graduate on/about 6 June.  I'm still hoping to break free for at least a couple of weekends but I have to wait until I am there to gauge the workload and study demands.  With any luck I hope to give you at least a weeks' notice before I head up to Denver/Boulder.</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top:1.2em;">We're looking forward to having you back, Matt!</p>
