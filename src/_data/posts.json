But, ta-da!, here's another shot at it! Anyone interested? It looks really easy: http://www.dot.state.co.us/AdoptAHighway/ And the good publicity couldn't hurt, eh?

        "comment_body":"Friday's action started innocently enough. The pack maintained a mostly civilized demeanor as they moved in colorful array through west Boulder's ancient neighborhoods. But once on Flagstaff Mountain, things quickly degenerated into a game of cat and mouse. Leary attacked halfway up the first major climb, Dressler countered, and Underwood fell into the slipstream, already wasted, a broken man. Meanwhile, at the top of the Hole, Bailey and Werner started their bridge-up, setting a blistering pace past the cheering fans shoehorned into the hallowed confines of Panorama Point. Leary pulled strong through Die Lorelie, leaving Dressler and Underwood to patch together an uneasy alliance in response to the all-out assualt by the Bailey-Werner duo. Somewhere in the vicinity of the Snakes, the day's hitherto halcyon weather took a nasty turn, thrashing the peleton with high winds, freezing sleet, and snow. Leary's epic solo effort was now hanging by a slender Antron thread as Werner-Bailey-Dressler-Underwood hastily threw together a desperate echelon. It was on The Wall, the place where so many of cycling's past heroes have met their inner devils, that Leary made his last, furious bid for immortality, hammering his admittedly dated bike up the last few meters of that holiest of hills. \nMerckx, Hinault, Armstrong, and now Leary. \nLeary? \n- Phil Ligget, March, 2005"

There's still a touch of corn-ice on Fourmile Creek and absolutely no green in the woods to speak of apart from the parched ponderosa needles.  Still, it was nice to reach Wallstreet, chuckle at the news kiosk in \"downtown\", quaff some gatorade mixed with water, listen to the wind chimes and the creek, and then coast down.  Hardly had to use my brakes either, as the wind was out of the southeast.  Just a nice day!</p>",

It was, in fact, about mountain climbing) when I heard a scream.</p>\n<p>I looked up to see Zack, hip-deep in the tidal bay, dancing wildly and holding a thrashing four-foot reef shark by the tail. The poor creature was throwing a fine spray of salt water into the air as it gyrated about, mouth agape and clearly panicked. The shark was equally agitated.</p>\n<p>Z had been fly fishing for bonefish on the sand flats when Jaws slammed his size 4 Green Meanie lure, and now the food chain appeared to be going through a review process.</p>\n<p>\"Dad!!!! He just took a chunk out of my finger!!! What should I do?!!!\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't bleed in the water, Z... you might attract more.\"</p>\n<p>I went back to my reading, thinking how tough it must be to put a climbing trip together in the Andes, what with everything being so remote and all. This book really made you realize how logistically challenging a big mountain is when you're faced with a multi-day approach and precious few local resources.</p>\n<p>\"<i>Dad!!! He's trying to kill me!!</i>\"</p>\n<p>Sure enough, though held at arm's length, the shark was coming within millimeters of Zack's ribs, each determined lunge bringing its snapping teeth closer to paydirt. Dark shapes could be seen gliding in across the turquoise flats to Zack's right. How cool; Zack had stumbled on a whole fleet of the buggers.</p>\n<p>Kids, Â I thought, returning to the book, they get into the damnedest predicaments sometimes. Just like the guy in this story. Imagine having your rope cut, then plummeting deep into a crevasse.

    "body":"<p>Phew!  What a week of riding!!  We went out everyday this week, which is a sign that spring has sprung.  On Thursday we were joined by Noel Lenski, Chair of Classics, for a classic butt-kicking spin up Old Stage Road that would've left Zeus in the dust.  Ouch!  The next day, Friday, we felt the sting of our hubris in our quads, struggling to keep the pedals ticking over on Sunshine Canyon's 14% slopes.  The clouds were welcome, as were the views of the Indian Peaks.</p>\n<p>Next week's agenda will be posted soon, so stay tuned.  I'm looking at fox/hound again on Monday, then possibly Fourmile Canyon on Tuesday, and maybe Super-Flag on Wednesday.  Let me know if you have preferences.  Otherwise, bon weekend, mes amis!!</p>",

        "comment_body":"Thursday: It was awesome watching Noel vaporize the east face Old Stage in his 42/21 <i>in the saddle</i>. Bet they could hear the rivets popping from Boulder Heights! And trading chops w/ the guys on the run down Left Hand was a blast! In my humble opinion we made the other lunch-time cyclists out there - and there was a ton of them - look like zombies...<br/>Friday: SuperSunshine was a super solar oven today. I was fried from the get-go. I'll be glad when Boulder Creek drops back below flood stage and we can hit the ol' swimmin' hole on the way back to the office again. <br/>Great pace today Greg and Steve!<br/>DU"

It was actually windy on our alternate route, Flagstaff, which is a rarity, as it's pretty well protected--but not from winds out of the southeast.  Anyhow, we were treated to a great battle between the Daves, as well as a super-strong ride from the ever-improving Mr. Burton, who will soon be dropping all of us, as he has youth on his side.  Anyhow, lots of fun coming down, and picture-perfect weather and temps.  <strong>Don't miss tomorrow's ride!!!</strong></p>",

We were able to test out the new drivetrain we got Dave (see photo at left).  He reports that he LOVES it!  The crankset is a Ritchey compact (50/34), with 172.5mm crank arms&mdash;much better for a tall guy like Mr. Underwood.</p>\n<p>We also got rid of the old cluster, replacing it with a <a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/DaveS600thFlagstaffRide#5395273465504706498\">new 12-28 cluster</a>.  So, if you're out on Poorman tomorrow, that hummingbird noise buzzing by you is Dave spinning his new drivetrain.  Rounding out the new equipment is a new chain, cuz why burn a new crankset and cluster with an old chain!</p>\n<p>Other frills that were throw in (for Dave's own personal safety): headset tightening, brake tightening, brake hub adjustment, and front wheel truing.  Now, with all this newfound speed and knee-saving efficiency, Dave needn't worry about breaking his handlebars or losing control on the descents.  <strong>Don't miss Wednesday's ride!!!</strong></p>",

I had the opportunity to rent a 2005 Specialized Roubaix Comp featuring a full carbon fiber frame and Shimano DuraAce drive train.</p>\n<p>On Saturday, June 10 I set out early from the town of Napa, CA to wind my way through the <a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/BurtonDoesNapaValley#5395889094864636498\">back roads of Napa county</a>, over the hills ringing the valley, west through the town of Sonoma, CA and finally swinging southeast for the return to Napa.  My planned route was just under 50 miles.  I had an incredible bike, plenty of water and nutrition, and an entire day to kill.</p>\n<p>The first 10 miles was on a two-lane road following a small creek that climbed from Napa's perch at 17' about sea level to a brisk 554' above sea level.  The next stage in \"Tour-de-Wine-Country\" put me to the test in a manner similar to our own Flagstaff Mountain.  The aptly-named Trinity road rose from 554' to 1750' in a mere 4.7 miles, including several sections with grades in excess of 9 percent.  The road for my efforts was a 7.2 mile down-hill section of steep grades and beautiful views.</p>\n<div class=\"left\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/BurtonDoesNapaValley\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh5.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/SuIMgi8oCKI/AAAAAAAABf8/dbT4UgLgpSk/s2400/DSCN0545.JPG\" /></a><br />Steep grades abounded</div>\n<p>After coming down the west side of the hills I entered the small town of Glen Ellen, CA - Home of Jack London State Historic Park.  After some two-hours and change into my ride I took a break in Glen Ellen for a well-earned Clif Bar.  From there I headed south towards Sonoma, passing the infamous Agua Caliente Road.  After another seven miles or so I entered the outskirts of Sonoma, CA.</p>\n<p>Attempting to bike through the town of Sonoma took nearly an hour. Navigating the side streets and bike paths was slow and difficult.  In retrospect I should have circumvented the town for a bit less stress and a bit more cycling.  I left Sonoma headed southeast on the shoulder of California Highway 12 towards my starting point in northwestern Napa.</p>\n<p>The next nine miles along highway 12 were uneventful, even with the high traffic, due a rather large and recently paved shoulder.  Just before entered the southern part of Napa-proper I elected to take a detour to the west on Old Sonoma Road to by-pass the southern section of the city.  After my misadventures navigating Sonoma I figured that a few extra miles of enjoyable riding was more prudent that returning quickly.</p>\n<div class=\"right\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/BurtonDoesNapaValley\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh6.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/SuIMiTDih6I/AAAAAAAABgM/-4Mcq2Vflz4/s2400/DSCN0548.JPG\" /></a><br />Winding roads of CA wine country</div>\n<p>Old Sonoma Road too me to a familiar road that ran near the house I was staying at for the weekend.  I savored the last few miles with the knowledge that I had little stamina left for further riding that day and I needed to return the bike that night.  The ride took just under five hours including a quick lunch stop in Glen Ellen and many, many frustrated stops in Sonoma\nattempting to navigate the city.</p>\n<p>The vertical profile took me from 17' in Napa to 554' near Dry Creek to 1750' at the top of Trinity to 206' in Glen Ellen to 50' in Sonoma andfinally back to 17' in Napa.</p>\n<p>This was a truly fantastic ride.  I could not have done it without Steve Bailey and his daily prodding to get me to start cycling and his constant encouragement to continue.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you for the plug, Matt!  I'm always happy to introduce people to the pleasures of masochism!  Ed.</em></p>",

Unfortunately I mistakenly grabbed the cruiser rather than the new carbon fiber road bike.  Oops.</p>\n<p>In spite of my foible, I was happy to be out on the bike, for I knew my friends would never make fun of me for riding a girly bike.  In fact, a few of them seemed to be genuinely jealous of my ride.</p>\n<p>We hit the road and eventually joined up with Linda Drake, who let me draft off her, which was very nice.  She claims she left us behind half way through the ride because she had to get back to the office, but I think she was embarrassed.  In any event, we had a great time, despite the sweltering heat.  Thanks for coming, everyone!</p>",

We can't see the true nature of how the clouds are acting until we speed the camera up. Then, at quadruple speed, we can tell exactly what's going on; the relative elasticity of time enables us to detect movements that we previously had overlooked or misinterprated. The same techniques and principles could be applied to Burton on his bike, though quadruple speed may prove insufficient.

    "body":"<p>Today's ride featured a legendary role reversal and the fall of a dynasty.  Or maybe not.</p>\n<p>Moments prior to the start of the ride Dave Underwood was seen canoodling with a sweet 20-something young lady with blonde hair, normally a task seen performed by Matt Burton.  This role reversal began the ride up Flagstaff Mountain on a beautiful day in the low-60's (just like Dave!).</p>\n<p>While Steve Bailey looked on to his amusement while Dave and Matt raced up the mountain as fast as their (relatively) leisurely pace would take them.  Dave held an initial lead only to have Matt catch up and thank Dave for waiting for him.  Dave was not waiting for him.</p>\n<p>At the top of \"The Wall\" just below the junction of the main road and the summit road the tide began to turn.  Steve Bailey describe the epic battle as akin to \"...watching the Tour.  Burton caught Dave's wheel and made an attack at just the right time.\"</p>\n<p>Steve was also heard mumbling about EPO, drugs, and performance-enhancing substances.  Nobody was listening.</p>\n<p>The role reversal was complete when Matt crossed the entrance to the summit parking area before Dave, beating Matt's personal best time in the process.  The (still) Mighty Dave finished third and his transition between \"elite athlete\" and \"old guy using decades' old stories to pick up impressionable young ladies\" was complete.</p>\n<p>The End.  Let the trash talk begin.</p>",

DU is confident he could do that, <i>if</i> he ate and slept well the night before and if his tires were well aired (so to speak). He might also want a wee bit of a handicap.<br/>As to canoodling, DU defers to MB. MB admittedly canoodles at a world-class level, and DU is awed. <br/>DU would like to remind MB that one goes into battle with the body one has, not the body one might want or wish to have at a later time. <br/>DU must go now; his Depends are binding."

There are some potentially good rides up off Linden Road, we just need to find one that does a loop.</p>\n<p>Dave and I ended up going up Cedar Brook Road, cresting a little col, then ending up at a dead end after descending a very serpentine street.  The riding was so fun, though, we didn't mind at all.</p>\n<p>In fact, we were so jazzed by the exploration that we may schedule another ride this week whose express intent is scouting routes.

But as the distance between us decreased, I noted the singular outward characteristics - the see-sawing motion of the bike against the violent rise of the mountain, the shoulders hunched and taut in a powerful knot of aggressive energy, the foppish pink bandana - that indelibly stamped the struggling figure as none other than the legend himself. I was at once awed and appalled, and just as he swept by me on that icy alpine rampart, I caught a fleeting glimpse of a man possessed. We closed then parted, and as he slogged away into the swirling mists, I could swear I heard him say, \"I hate this cold weather; it makes my Poly-Grip feel like axle grease.\"\nAnd then he was gone."

Great views in every direction and really gnarly sandstone uplifts all along the ridge. And as a bonus there's all the weird stuff on top: the weather station, the bunker, the water tank, etc... And the mailbox. We were really wishing we had a stray NetFlix envelope to slip in there. <br/>Check it out sometime. Bow's a nice change of pace.<br/>DU"

    "body":"<p>Due to a mix-up on my part, the Frenzy's new outfit, the Frenzy Fleetfeet (recently acquired in a hostile Wall Street takeover), celebrated the Frenzy's Second Anniversary in fine style.</p>\n<p>A group of walking enthusiasts, the Fleetfeet are renown for their fabulist leanings, as evidenced by their very first report, submitted by Mark:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"right\"><img src=\"http://xo.typepad.com/blog/images/drunk.jpg\" /><br />The Frenzy Fleetfeet's <q>spirited</q> workout</div>\n<p>Jill Lester and Werner embarked on the stroll version of the frenzy today. We left TCOM at 12:05.</p>\n<p>Our route took us down 18th to Colorado, then along the east side of the stadium to Folsum. From there we joined the creek path. We left the path at the junction by Arapaho.</p>\n<p>We had a nice walk through the arboretum until the ice flows on the sidewalk made us search for snow that was sufficiently soft to be able to walk on. As we came up the stairs from that arboretum path, we emerged on Grandview and the temperature picked up quite a bit.</p>\n<p>We had a nice stroll along the Varsity Pond and then ended up by Hellems. It was a wonderful day with a great blue sky and a temperature that hovered between jacket weather and not.</p>\n<p>The conversation was good. We walked and talked in the fine tradition of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_%28school%29\">Aristotle's Gymnasium</a>.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Great report, Fleetfeet!  Thanks for joining the lunchtime crew, even if we weren't technically there.</p>\n<p>Next time, though, please use something more creative than a paper bag to conceal your high spirits, if you catch my drift.  Yeah, Mark, we all know why you stumbled around that \"ice\" floe on the path.</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/icebreaker.jpg\" /><br />In the Shackleton spirit, Steve tests the leads on Poorman Loop</div>\n<p>For my part, I explored Poorman Loop this afternoon.  It's been a long winter, and I wasn't certain the route would be passable.  Indeed, in rather uncharacteristic Frenzy fashion, we haven't done Fourmile Canyon since last fall.</p>\n<p>Thus, astride my trusty two-wheeled conveyance, I set out to see how sketchy the ride up Boulder Canyon was.  As it turns out, Boulder Canyon wasn't that bad, especially since I was climbing as opposed to descending.</p>\n<p>Fourmile Canyon was as peaceful as always...I've missed riding alongside Fourmile Creek.  Not a single car passed me on the easy ascent.</p>\n<p>Poorman Road was in the best condition I've ever seen.  Apparently, the constant freezing has kept the dust and gravel off the road&mdash;the surface was as hard as pavement!  The only hazard turned out to be two sheets of 1\" thick ice, which I simply walked the bike over.</p>\n<p>Overall, great ride.  If the snow's not too bad this weekend, we should be able to go back next week.  Meantime, have a great weekend, everyone!!</p>",

Those familiar with Dan Brown's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Da_Vinci_Code\">fiction</a> are well-aware of the alleged female figure in Leonardo's <em>chef d'&oelig;uvre</em>.</p>\n<p>Though the notoriety generated by Mr. Brown's spurious work has certainly heightened the scrutiny the tempera on the walls of the Santa Maria delle Grazie now receives (leaving Frenzy Elders' nerves fricass&eacute;ed, to say the least), the collective gaze of the curious is focused on the forest, not the trees.</p>\n<div class=\"left\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XrTaGIWXoRLXwAfSjMHwCQ?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh6.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/SvS4ubaMa4I/AAAAAAAACPo/Jr1hkui5Mr8/s2400/frenzy-hq-floorplan.jpg\" /></a><br />HQ floorplan, reprinted without permission of The Frenzy of Scion</div>\n<p>This emboldens me.</p>\n<p>So, with the begrudging blessing of our Elders, I call your attention to the softest of brush strokes (whose subdued hue I cannot now precisely recall) just over the <a href=\"http://www.italianfrescoes.com/img/Last-Supper.jpg\">left shoulder of the apostle John</a>, yonder where the wispy trees on the hill slope luff in the gentle <em>Ponente</em> winds.  There is where you'll find it.</p>\n<p>Again, to the dismay of the Elders, I have taken the liberty of producing a facsimile of said strokes, confident that modern technology will fail to capture their revelatory <em>Geist</em>, thus further obfuscating the Truth.  Train your eyes carefully, Gentle Readers!</p>\n<p>In the realm of Literature, there are more explicit directions.</p>\n<p>For instance, Poe's <em>The Cask of Amontillado</em> ostensibly recounts the descent of the injurious Fortunato into the catacombs of Montresors.  Those with a fealty for the figural language of fiction will follow poor Fortunator down the wrong path.</p>\n<p>The more astute among you will glean much from the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"right\" style=\"margin-top:0.5em;\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/icegulch14/ParisTrip#5386742284305025058\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh6.ggpht.com/_MLtKexEhbk0/SsGNkUCTyCI/AAAAAAAABRw/IwbW1wZBEwM/s2400/15.JPG\"></a><br />Steve's pal Darwin at Frenzy HQ</div>\n<p>At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious.  Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.  Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner.  From the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size.  Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven.  It seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In November of 1997, one literal-minded soul entered the catacombs but didn't quite make it to our crypt.  He left <a href=\"http://members.tripod.com/~cutunnel/zjournal1.html\">detailed instructions</a> for those foolish enough to follow, though.</p>\n<p>A Frenzy Elder is clutching his chest complaining of acute pressure, so I must away.  Perhaps I'll bump into you someday in a dank crypt, flambeau in one hand, bike in the other.  In the meantime, stop pinging us for GPS co&ouml;rdinates!</p>",

I've discovered that my bike has been shimmying like Fannie Fox (The Tidal Basin Bombshell; remember?) because the sidewalls of my rear tire have rotted through and the inner tube is herniating through the gaps. Makes for an amusing shape and a bumpy ride. I'm scared to take it over, say, 15 mph in its current state.<br/>So I'm going to nurse the old beater over to the Sanitas trailhead and run the South Ridge today. <br/>I'll try to hit Performance tonight and grab a new tire.<br/>Have fun boxing.

Ouch!  That was the most painful ride ever.  Yes, I said <q>ride</q>!</p>\n<p>I rode my commuter bike up to the Gregory Canyon Trailhead, locked up, and hit the trail with the goal of running <a href=\"http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/initiation_view.jpg\">Initiation</a>.  After about 100 steps on the trail, I bagged that plan.</p>\n<p>Every rock, root, and waterbar was covered with a veneer of treacherous ice.  And I worked on <a href=\"http://www.mountwashington.org\">Mount Washington</a>, so I know deadly glazing when I see it.</p>\n<p>I did an about-face, remounted the commuter bike, and pointed my front tire at Flagstaff, where the road still hadn't glazed over.  Everything else&mdash;trees, gutters, grass&mdash;had, though.</p>\n<p>Riding up (made the gate) I wore a polypro sleeveless tank and my neon rain slick.  On the way down, I shed the tank and put on my fleece hat, fleece pullover, down vest, and rain slick.  If I had a pair of mittens with rain protection, I would've been fine.</p>\n<p>But, dummy that I am, I brought gloves, which insta-froze on the descent.  Fortunately, I survived but only barely.  Harshest weather yet for me....</p>\n<p>I saw a pro on a road bike heading up on my way down.  He had no descending gear, so I hope he turned around at Panorama Point!</p>\n<p>We'll be watching <em>H&ouml;llentour</em> in Humanities tonight.  Lemme know if you're interested.

(After all, democracy functions best in broad daylight.)</p>\n<p>If anyone would like to join Dave on Anemone, let him (me) know.</p>",

Starting this Thursday, August 2, Flagstaff Road is going to be very slow and unpleasant, for both cyclists and motorists. Cyclists should expect rough pavement, heavy equipment, and construction activities along the entire stretch of road on weekdays from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Single-lane restrictions will occur most of the day during construction with total road closures of 20 to 25 minutes at a time. We expect construction activity to start at the Amphitheater and work its way downhill as the project continues. Construction is expected to be completed by Friday, August 10. No construction activities or associated delays are expected over the weekend.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dave, what are you going to do now?</p>",

I made it to Alabama and I just finished my first seven days\nof Officer Training School.  What an experience it has been.  This is\nby far the hardest thing I have ever done.  Ever.\n<br /><br />\nFirst, the over-arching theme has been the total and utter lack of\ntime to do anything.  We get up around 0445 and immediately fall out\nfor 0500 physical training.  We have drill, academics, paperwork, and\nvarious other tasks until 2300.  We usually stay up an hour or two\npast this time (with flashlights after \"lights out\") to get our room\nstraight and inspection order.\n<br /><br />\nThe worst part is the total lack of time we have to complete our\nassigned duties and coursework.  This is, of course, by design.\nUpperclassmen -- officer trainees in the class ahead of us -- are our\nsupervisors and commanders.  They continually \"time-jack\" us by making\nus recite our daily memorization items consisting of both qoutes and\nsmall tidbits of Air Force knowledge (honor code, core values, etc).\nThere is much yelling involved.    Yes, we have actual Drill Sergeants\nhere at OTS.\n<br /><br />\nThe last week has felt like a month.  There is some relief on the\nhorizon but it's another three weeks away at least. It's a very\nhard, physically and mentally demanding program.\n<br /><br />\nI will write again when I get the chance.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin-top:1.3em;\">Did he say <acronym title=\"Officer Training School\">OTS</acronym> was <q>by far</q> the hardest thing he's ever done? We must have gone too easy on him...either that or time has healed his Frenzy wounds.</p>\n<p>Don't you think Dennis is kind of like a drill sergeant?</p>",

The turning leaves, the smell of pumpkin pie in the air, the sight of a Trunk Monkey blazing past on the side of the road.<br /><br /> \nI guess some of us have different Octobers\"¦<br /><br /> \nNeva Road was beautiful today; a bit chilly getting started, but downright warm by the end of things. Other than that, a pretty standard ride, with The Replacement going from one end of the pack to the other, Sparky keeping a pretty nice pace throughout (I think she was practicing for when she's on the lam for setting her building on fire\"¦), and OT Steve providing some of that cool optimism as always.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matt has filed another report from Alabama:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThe attached photo is of Officer Trainee (OT) Bogle and myself, OT Burton.  We just finished up our very first MREs, which were quite delicious.  We finished Small Unit Tactics I & II that morning as well as land navigation.  Tactical communication and first aid comprised the afternoon after the photo.<br /><br />\nWe agreed that we would both do Super Flag ten times back-to-back instead of going through OTS if we could.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Don't worry, Matt.  We'll make sure you get your 10 Super-Flag wish upon your return in December.  Please come prepared.  Thanks for measuring the difficulty of OTS using the \"Frenzy Scale\".</p>\n<h6>Save the Date!</h6>\n<p><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/FirstFreakyFrenzy\">Freaky Frenzy</a> this Wednesday at noon!</p>",

        "comment_body":"The keen eye sees more than a few oddities in young Burton's photo.<br/>The rifles; as if the bright orange color weren't strange enough, a cursory glance tell us there are no holes in the barrels. Oh, I suppose the sight of a Day-Glo orange weapon borne by a strapping young lieutenant with good teeth and a deep tan might in and of itself send Commie Johnny into deep apoplexy, the preferred state for one's enemy. But still, for the sake of the occasional savant in the trenches, holes would be nice.<br/>And something appears to be crumpled and tightly grasped in MB's right hand. Something hastily hidden from our view, something young Burton would rather we not see. A Twinky wrapper? Answers to this afternoon's exam in advanced avionics? A note from Mom? We can only guess.<br/>Burton's companion is wearing rubber gloves. Do you think that's unusual? Are our fighting forces suffering from dishpan hands, fending off ugly rashes and worse? And why is MB so cavalier about his own hands, recklessly exposing them to the raw winds of an Alabama fall day? Is he bucking for a Purple Heart while still in Boot Camp? Or?<br/>Answers to these questions and more when MB returns to his friends in December. Can't wait to get the poop!<br/>DU"

He held the leader's yellow jersey for much of the Tour de France before being expelled by Rabobank for allegedly lying to the team.<br /><br />\n<q>I was not in Mexico in June,</q> Rasmussen said at a news conference. <q>I have given wrong information to the UCI and the public.

To put this finding in perspective, there were 785 bicycling fatalities on American roadways in 2005, compared to 4,881 pedestrian and 43,443 automotive fatalities that same year.<br /><br />\nOn the other hand, a Danish study found that people who do not bike to work suffer a 39 percent higher mortality rate than those who do. So, assuming you can avoid a fatal accident on the road, biking to work may actually help you live longer.<br /><br />\nFrom <a href=\"http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/will-bicycling-to-work-get-you-killed/\">Will Bicycling to Work Get You Killed</a>?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin-top:1.2em;\">Bring your ski masks tomorrow (that means <strong>YOU</strong>, Greg).

Hope no one had plans to rendezvous with me on Boxing Boulder.</p>\n<p>Now, either Dave was fibbing about riding Flagstaff or <a href=\"http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2007/11/26/flagstaff-ride-report-39#comment-564\">he rode at an entirely different</a> time of day, because I didn't see him on the ascent or descent.  The former was typical with tee-shirt temps and decent conditions, but the latter was a bear.</p>\n<p>It's surprising how the black tongues of icy water running across the road can seem so harmless on the way up and yet so deadly on the way down.  I dismounted repeatedly or rode in the oncoming traffic lane just because it felt <q>safer</q> at the time.</p>\n<p>Due to the repeated braking, I was happy I brought all the gear I did, even if Sir Kent poked fun at me in front of the stadium.  It was chilly on the nerve-wracking downhill section!</p>\n<p>If you have a second or two to kill, check out a <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/environment/071123-bts-yannick.html\">recently published article</a> by our very own Adriana.  It details why scientists still use kites and blimps to understand the atmosphere and turbulence (&agrave; la Ben Franklin)!</p>\n<h6>Report from Alabama</h6>\n<p>Our favorite Gomer has filed another, more upbeat report from Officer Training School:</p>\n<blockquote>As many of you know I celebrated my 26th birthday here at OTS on 14\nNovember.  Thank you to everybody that sent presents, greeting cards,\ne-cards, and even home-made cards.  My squadron sang \"Happy Birthday\"\nto me after we formed up for morning PT at 0500.  That evening I\ngrabbed a slice a cake out of the dessert cooler at evening chow.\nOther than that it was any other day at Air Force OTS.<br /><br />\nOur upperclass graduated on Tuesday.  It involved quite a bit of pomp\nand circumstance.  There was a formal parade with both the upper and\nlower class participating.  The parade, of course, featured an F-16\nfly-by.  The departure of the upper class means we are half-way to our\nsecond lieutenant bars.<br /><br />\nWe were invited into the homes of local officers and their families\nfor Thanksgiving.  Lieutenant Colonel Destry Rogers, a special\noperations C-130 pilot, and his family took me for Thanksgiving.  It\nwas a welcome respite from the tomfoolery of OTS.  I had my first beer\n(actually, my first five over the course of the day) and watched\nfootball for the first time since OTS began.  One of his classmates at\nthe Air War College, a marine F-18 pilot, also joined us.  Both of\nthem provided valuable insight and a much needed reality check.  A\ngood time was had by all.<br /><br />\nOur class is now alone on the OTS campus for the entirety of next\nweek.  After that our lower class comes in and the weeks begin to move\nquickly again.  We have a very high concentration of graded activities\nthat count towards graduation in the first three weeks of December.\nEssentially we will have all graded activities except for the final\nphysical fitness assessment and our final officer trainee performance\nreport out of the way.  Believe or not the end is in sight.<br /><br />\nThrough out this whole process our squadron historian has been taking\npictures.  Now that we are at the half-way point we distributed the\npictures to each person.\n</blockquote>\n<p>Can't wait 'til MB is back so we can hold him to his word.  Remember how he said he could do Super-Flag 10 times no problem?!</p>",

At one point it took everything I had (and I was on my 40lb truck) to keep from being pushed from the bike lane into traffic.  I figure I was pushed about 15ft from the curb.</p>\n<br /><br />'Tis December, I reckon.\n</blockquote>\n<p>This won't be the last whining you hear from me!</p>",

Yuck!</p>\n<p>Despite the ever-present sand on the road, conditions were largely dry and tacky.  The descent is hard, in terms of choosing the right hand-warmer: gloves or mittens.</p>\n<p>Today, I chose the latter, and wasn't thrilled about the lack of brake-gripping.  They're better for mountain or cruiser bikes.  Gloves (of the full-fingered variety) are better-suited to road bikes.  Unfortunately for me, I could only find my cut-off (summer) gloves, which I wore on the ascent.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, more important matters need to be discussed!  I'm thinking about a Frenzy overnight ski/snowshoe the weekend of February 23-24 in the Indian Peaks.  Hopefully no sub-zero temps this year.  Who's in?</p>",

Temperatures really haven't changed much over the course of the day.</p>\n<p>The fog/mist and snow from this morning lingered indeed, enabling me to sport a nice steam coat on the ascent.

For those of you not familiar with the cheap, imitation of an imitation contraption, only the 3s and 6s work.  This means if your pre-packaged, highly processed meal requires numerals other than the aforementioned, you're in for a lot of cook-time babysitting, which <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel6/8203/24832/01123206.pdf?arnumber=1123206\">apparently isn't good for you</a> (if you're a mouse?).</p>\n<p>Note to self: now that students are back on campus, schedule rides outside of class-change times.</p>",

They kept leaning out of their mini-van with those big zoom lenses, trying to get an \"action shot\" of SB. (No luck, really; they'll have to use the motion blur in Photoshop to give the pix any sort of credibility.) They kept crowding our little peloton, and I thought someone was going to get hurt. It all turned out fine, though, and after three laps around the park, we all headed over to Village Inn for their Blended Sizzler's. Thank God for the big-print menus! SB almost ordered \"chew food\" by mistake.

He's much more sinewy now, and I could sense that the things he's seen - the topless bars in Pensacola, the mad runs for more guac at 2 AM, the bladegrass putting greens of the Deep South, the endless, cloying Harvey Wallbangers in the Junior Officer's club - had changed him deeply. He had that wizened, steely look that a man can only acquire in the crucible of combat... or at least from watching a lot of it on NetFlix. <br/>I noticed also that MB's long-term red state exposure seems to have permanently twisted his top. When the barkeep at Juanita's asked if he would like a microbrew, he said \"No ma'am, I'd like a regular sized one.\"    <br/>Yikes..."

No more spare tubes. I want to call Ronna for a lift, but realize I've forgotten my cell phone. I start walking off toward the soccer fields, borrow a cell phone from a nice lady walking a beagle, call Ronna, tell her I'll be over on Iris in 15 minutes. I walk all the way down some very quiet street by the cemetery, realize it's a dead-end, and that there's a 6 - 7 foot high chain link fence with a very ragged top between me and Iris. Bummer. I hang the bike on the top of the fence, toss the pack over, then remember the yoghurt (that's right; it all popped open inside the pack) I take off my cleats and climb the fence barefoot, slicing up my big toe and tearing my shorts on the way over... <i>rrrriiip</i>. Then I drag my bike across, bending one of the shifters and screwing up the front brakes. I walk over to Iris and wait for Ronna. And wait. And wait. To put more zest into the situation, I've had a full pot of coffee for breakfast, and I could really use a little privacy and a bush. No luck; it's rush hour and the nearest tree is in the front yard of the day care across the street (Wouldn't <i>that</i> be a headline?). The only thing that keeps my mind off my increasing agitation is watching the two colonies of ants fight over the yoghurt oozing out of the bottom of my pack.

SB and I briefly interrupted our Poorman ascent to help a couple look for their lost son. He'd been missing for over half an hour, and had disappeared while chasing butterflies. The creek was way high, and they were pretty sure he had tried to cross. Yikes. Call in the divers, break out the hooks. Other bikers stopped, cell phones were flipped open, and things were approaching meltdown. (One guy on a mountain bike was almost smacked by a Jeep as he crossed the road to join the search.) But then, just as some guy was dialing 9-1-1, SB mentioned seeing an old codger up the road, milling about like he was looking for a place to relieve himself. Case solved; that was him... the 62 year-old son (the dad was pushing ninety, mom a spry eighty-something).<br /><br />\nOtherwise, a nice breezy trip up our favorite dirtpile.

Mike was the master, lofting drives up to the tee mostly. He definitely broke par. <br/><br/>Doris and I were more the \"duffers\" of the outing. Doris tried various frisbees, some designed for disc golf, and others for general use. She experimented with various throws: how much to snap the wrist, how much of a lead to give yourself, at what height to let go... <br/><br/>I struggled with my new driver which slices left dramatically (not unlike my regular golf drives). The wind was quite gusty, which made the course more challenging. <br/><br/>A good time was had by all and we hope to get more people out sometime in the future. Perhaps the cycling frenz can play a version of polo by combining mountain bikes with frisbees."

        "comment_body":"Ever since Lance Armstrong made \"testicular\" a household word, Americans have avidly followed bike racing. Me too. Thus it was, when perusing the cycling news section in the Denver Post (hint; it's just south of the section devoted to water wrestling), that I noticed our own lovely and talented Steve Bailey will be racing in this weekend's Bob Cook Hillclimb, otherwise known as the Race to the Troposphere. How exciting. <br/><br/>I'm anxious to see how SB does. While it's true that Steve is a true scrapper, he's no common schoolyard pug, nosiree Bob. He may be fiercely competitive, but he's also habitually analytical and deeply thoughtful, which is to say he cheats. It'll be interesting to see what happens when the 30cc of HGH2 kicks in. The guy he bought it from assures him that it's well-buffered, and that the shakes and blurred vision shouldn't present that much of a problem. The stuttering could be an issue though, but it usually goes away in 3 - 5 days. (Please don't tease him next week.) <br/><br/>If Steve can hang onto the handlebars and if the hallucinations don't invite him to the All-U-Can-Eat pizza buffet just over that cliff, he should do quite well, possibly even finishing in the top 90 percent. Let's all wish him good luck! <br/><br/>My wheel is still getting fixed, so I'm on foot again today.<br/><br/>DU"

We rode up to the gate together, then he aimed for SuperFlag, and I headed back down, being mostly out of time by now.</p>\n<p>Halfway down, I snapped another spoke (front wheel) and was riding with a bad case of the wobbles when I had my 3rd flat (front wheel) of the day. I was out of tubes, so I decided to ride it back to the office on the rim, i. e., to-hell-with-it. Noel caught up w/ me back on Baseline and rode alongside me for a bit, but I think the smell of burning rubber from my front wheel really got to him.

As you by now I'm doing joint pilot training with the Navy; that is I am in the Air Force and doing an exchange program of sorts.\n<br /><br />The last stop before \"flying the plane\" pilot training is API.  It consists of four weeks of in-depth academics covering aerodynamics, weather, systems, flight rules, and navigation.  In addition we completed Navy water survival, land survival, and parachute qualification.\nBut enough of my babbling... onto the videos!\n<dl>\n<dt>The Dreaded Helo Dunker (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53ZJiHOKAIQ&feature=related\">Video</a>)</dt>\n<dd>Courtesy of a class that came through a couple weeks before I did.  We had to take three rides in the darned thing from three different positions.  On the last ride we wore goggles that were spray painted black to simulate nighttime conditions.</dd>\n<dt>Redneck Parasailing (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKGb3suwJc0\">Video</a>)</dt>\n<dd>This is the last event before 'graduating' from API.  We spend time in both the classroom and in gravel pits practicing our landings prior to the big day.  It's 'Redneck' because we're being towed behind an F-350 instead of behind a boat.  Can you believe I'm getting paid to do this?!</dd>\n</dl>\nIn true Navy fashion I have about three weeks downtime with minimal work during the week until I start formal pilot training.  It kicks off on 25 Aug with two weeks of academics before FINALLY hitting the flight line. <br /><br />\nUntil then...</blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin-top:1.2em;\">Dave, what's your take on all this?</p>",

The Departments of Energy, State, Defense, and Justice have been merged into one new office, The Department of Public Works. \"It worked really well in Wasilla,\" said the former Miss Mukluk as she signed the executive order directing the massive changes. \"You could get anything you needed by simply dialing one number. We even mailed out those little magnetic do-hickeys you can put on your fridge!\"\n\nPalin has pegged political unknown Cole Bledsoe to head the new organization. Bledsoe, who hails from Moosepellet Alaska and has a PhD. in Hillbilly Science from Bob Jones University, spoke with the press about the challenges of filling leadership roles in the new mega-agency, saying \"It's hard enough finding one decent horseman in Alaska, not to mention four.\" \n\nPresident Palin, who will be hunting and camping somewhere on the White House grounds over the weekend, has scheduled a press conference for Monday morning in the executive skinning room.</i>\n\nGad.\n\nDU"

I am now in formal pilot training at NAS Whiting Field.  Everything I did before was akin to the minor leagues leading up to this.  From here on out every grade on every test, briefing, and maneuver counts towards which plane I will fly in the future.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I had my first flight in the T-34.  The experience was quite a rush; it was much different (read: faster and more maneuverable) than anything I had flown before.  The first two-hour sortie passed by quickly and I can't wait to get in the air again.  I love the smell of jet fuel in the morning!</p>\n<p>Check out these YouTube videos to get a (humorous) look at flying the T-34 out of NAS Whiting Field.  No, I'm not in them -- I don't have the time or the inclination to get permission to haul a camera up with me at the moment.  Rest assured I will try to get some in-flight action shots before too long.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\"Navy Flight School\"</dt>\n<dd><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx3Vjkqz9V8\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx3Vjkqz9V8</a></dd>\n<dt>\"Making a Pilot, Vol. 1\"</dt>\n<dd><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iwSuWb2gMg\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iwSuWb2gMg</a></dd>\n</dl>\n<p>I wish I could be a bit more verbose in my description of pilot training but the ability to write escapes me at the moment.

I had looked at a Google Map before, but today I had to rely more on the Force than anything else.</p>\n<p>Apparently, the Force is strong within me.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I had to ignore road signs like <q>Street Closed</q> and <q>Rough Road</q> in order to stay on course.  The driver of the white van that passed me near the top of Arkansas Mountain looked truly stunned as I rode by.</p>\n<p>Still, this is not much different from Poorman or Northwest Passage, with the exception of its length, 20.5 miles, and of course keeping in mind that much of that distance is loose dirt at an incline of 15% and above.</p>\n<p>The beauty of the ride, aside from the sudden views that come out of nowhere, is that each of the steeps is accompanied by a \"recovery roost,\" where you have ample time to prepare for the next climb and admire Fourmile Canyon far below.</p>\n<p>Arkansas Mountain Road is a tricky descent, as it's been recently graded and suddenly turns into beach sand.  I almost bought the farm once, but it's doable.  Took 1.5hrs.</p>\n<p>So, if you're up for this adventure sometime soon, vote in today's poll!</p>",

Luckily, my hotel agreed to hold onto some of my stuff.  I was more mobile for it.</p>\n<p>To stay awake, I just started walking north, which is quite a workout given all the hills here.  Before dawn, I passed Lombard Street, crookedest street in the U.S., and several other landmarks.  No one was about, so I had the town to myself.</p>\n<p>After some time, I found a breakfast joint (<em>Home Plate</em>), where I grabbed coffee and a bite.  From there, I wandered around looking for the bike rental place, whose whereabouts I vaguely remembered from looking at GMaps&mdash;yes, Sean, an iPhone would've saved me some meandering (still, I found my way by actually <em>talking</em> to people...imagine that?!).</p>\n<p>After renting a bike, I headed through The Presidio, across the bridge, and toward the Marin Headlands.  Somehow I ended up on a hiking-only trail, but the NPS trail workers who spotted me were tremendously nice and pointed me toward the actual biking trails.</p>\n<p>From there I passed through Sausalito, a wealthy town with a houseboat community (and snobby bike shop).  After several more rollers and onshore breezes, I ended up in my destination, Tiburon.  From Tib, I took the ferry back to town, jumped a streetcar, and arrived at my conference hotel in time for orientation.  Great day!</p>\n<p>As a funny aside, I was a little worried that, given the constraints of trying to pack two small carry-on bags with clothes for 13,000 feet, the beach, and a \"with-it\" town, I would arrive at the conference somewhat of a rag-tag clown.</p>\n<p>Ah, but these are the Arts and Humanities, and judging from the sartorial choices of my conference peers, I fit right in.  I even ironed my shirts!</p>\n<p>As another aside, while at the Mauna Loa Observatory, I bumped into a Google engineer who, like me, was riding his wife's coattails at 13,000 feet in Hawaii.  It just so happens that he's working on a beta project called <a href=\"http://knol.google.com/k\">Knol</a> aimed at higher education.  We're officially invited to test drive it and provide feedback.  Serendipitous, eh?!</p>\n<p>See y'all soon!  Go Sox!!</p>",

While my fingers thrum away at the desktop and I search for a more appropriate word, let's examine the facts. \n\nSB has flown over 300,000 miles in just the past six months. While we worker ants have dug ever deeper into the parched sands of the University, our hairfine legs wobbling under burdens twice our size, Herr Bailey has visited Hawaii, Latvia, San Francisco, Washington (all three of them), St Tropez, Tahiti, St. Petersburg, Bermuda, Moscow, Old and New Belgium, London, Paris, Miami, Gandwanaland (still the same old place), Saigon, and the far-flung Isles of Langerhans. That's the short list. \n\nOh, how we \"love\" looking up through sweat-rimmed lids to see yet another of SB's travelogues. Nothing quite like seeing the free flight of the butterfly from the dank confines of the diving bell. Guys in the joint know the feeling; a postcard from Curly (Cell 23, the A-bunk, 16 years) from someplace with lots of sun and, just around the corner, two-for-one specials on well drinks every afternoon. Curly's new friend Lola says hi. \n\nBut this is <i>video</i>, for gosh sake! \n\n<i>Narrator: We liked this spa a lot because, as you can see, Mt. Pukliaki is just visible over the roof of the swim-up bar. And you can almost smell the mint wrap in this scene, can't you? \n\nVoice in background: More ice please! And could you let the guy in the Hummer know we'd like the tire pressure lowered a few pounds for the drive up to the waterfall? We detest a rough ride.</i>\n\nIt's not as if we don't travel. Last summer there was the trip back to Uncle Gaylan's place in Indiana. What a thrill! Re-brazing a hog trough in the mid-day heat... boy, there's a memory no one can <i>ever</i> steal. And I'll never forget playing deviled egg roulette (Is <i>this</i> the one that they forgot to refrigerate?) in my cousin's double-wide in Garden City. Torrents of fun, true... but is this something you want to see posted on the Frenzy in living color? That's what I thought. \n\nWe shouldn't complain; we have a good job and a warm seat near a window... Picture Uriah Heep with a Mac, though not nearly as healthy. And next summer, if the Tercel doesn't throw a rod or something, we may get to go see Mom's cousin Sadie in Amarillo. There's a nice HoJo's on the way, and her hide-a-bed is real cush. \n\nNow what <i>is</i> that word? \n\nDU"

If the weather holds, if the humidity stays low, and if the backlit leaves shimmer and vibrate like speckled trout in fast-moving water, we can use the German <i>Verflertaugensteigen</i> for Thursday. I'm worried about Friday.\n\nIn any case, Linden Loop was a super ride. Thanks, Rob and Steve.\n\nAnd speaking of super... Super Tuesday is only a week away, and you can really smell the desperation coming from the McCain/Palin camp. Smells like... defeat. Look for Gollum and Daisy Mae to really crank up the heat on their Obama-left-the-seat-up-again campaign until this whole wretched thing finally pulls up to the curb and shuts off the motor.\n\nBut now the mud simply won't stick. I think the American people are finally done with this stuff. Mind you, I don't think they're any smarter - after all, these are the same brainiacs who <i>re-elected</i> GWB. \n\nI just think it's our turn to get lucky.\n\nSo, however we get it, let's prepare to savor victory, our delivery from eight years of darkness, incompetence, and swagger. \n\nAnd let's wish La Palin a nice bus ride back to Wasilla, America's little window into the Paleolithic. \n\nDU"

But, when I stepped out the door today, lo and behold, there was Brian Hutchison.</p>\n<p>Now, I won't attribute any malicious intent to Mr. Hutchison&mdash;I'm sure he was just looking for some company on his lunch ride.  But, despite his innocent intentions, I had a feeling I was in for a painful day in the saddle.</p>\n<p>I wasn't disappointed.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://vitamincottagecycling.com/v/archive/2008/04/29/4601.aspx\">full cycling team kit</a> served notice that I was in for some suffering.  That wasn't all that worried me, though.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Mr. Hutchison was running a non-compact crankset.  What earthly cyclist rides Flag with those gears?!  He then informed me he was going <q>medium intensity</q> on this afternoon's ride: climbing the 10% grades exclusively in the big ring.  Of course, I think he was just trying to make me feel better; he was likely at <q>easy</q> intensity.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, my hackles verily raised, I resigned myself to wheel-clinging, figuring it best to hang on for dear life.  I'd hate to see this guy's <q>high intensity</q> days.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, as I lost contact on the third of <em>Three Easy Pieces</em>, I heard Phil and Paul saying, <q>Oooh, Bailey's dropped. He's got to be careful here.  He's got to ride within himself up to the summit.</q></p>\n<p>Indeed, I felt a little like Jan Ullrich looking down at the pedals wondering where the power went.</p>\n<p>Great ride, Brian!  Thanks for joining us.  Please feel free to tag along again during one of your <q>very easy</q> days.</p>",

Victory.\n\nThat nasty little wasp who rode part of the way down Boulder Canyon with me yesterday must've been packing some heavy artillery. \n\nHe tasered me 4 or 5 times while he was onboard, which I find curious. I know that honeybees sting once, then nobly fall on their swords and die. But is not the wasp family subject to any sort of upper limit on moving violations? This guy clearly had been saving up. Today my so-called chest looks like a London Broil. And I'll just bet the little bastid is perched on a rock somewhere above the Elephant Butress this morning, telling his buddies about how he almost drove the milkface on the bike into the ditch yesterday. Hope he freezes to death.\n\nSpeaking of determined sadists, I had my last follow-up appointment with Our Lady of the Scalpels this week. She's the surgeon who so neatly lifted my rib last June. She was trying to determine if I could still be considered a \"billable object,\" or if I had any remaining bones she might be needing to fill out her collection.\n\nShe was positively effusive, and a quick glance at the wall behind her told me why. It was a newly framed and mounted certificate proclaiming her recent acceptance into the International Meatcutters Union, Local No. 5.\n\n\"I wasn't sure they'd admit me. Their standards are super tough,\" she told me.\n\n\"You must be very proud,\" I said.\n\n\"I am. And you know, in this economy, having a backup is never a bad idea. I think they were especially taken with my skills with the bow saw.\"\n\n\"Me too. You did a real number on me. But other than the sound of the Shop Vac, I hardly remember a thing.\"\n\n\"You were an easy patient. You can put your shirt back on now. Please. Please.\"\n\nAs I buttoned up, she said \"Well, everything looks fine. I think you can safely return to your normal activities now.\"\n\nGreat... Problem is, I don't <i>have</i> any normal activities.\n\nRight, Frenz?\n\nDU"

Those workers who weren't physically sickened were nonetheless sent home and scheduled to begin intensive counseling as early as this morning.

They had the usual assortment of squeaky, stomach-churning rides and threadbare oddities of nature in canvas huts. Standard-issue stuff to be sure; I'd seen it all a thousand times before.\n\nIt was one of the \"skill booths\" that really got my attention. We'd already worked our way through the ring toss and the paddle-ball arcades when we came to this particular beauty. It looked easy enough at first, so I decided to give it a shot. \n\nBut it was no cakewalk. If you think the bobbing ducks in the marksman's arcade are tough to hit, you should have seen this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAGdsoaZUyE\" rel=\"nofollow\">thing.</a> I was determined to win a cupie doll or a stuffed polar bear for the kids, but after going through a full stack of quarters I realized I simply didn't have the chops. I didn't hit the damned thing even once. \n\nI felt like a total heel and the kids pouted all the way home.\n\nSB and I are doing Flag today, right SB?\n\nDU"

It feels a bit like <em>The Shining</em>, though not nearly as lighthearted. Since it's so slow, I've taken to poking around in the back rooms and storage closets, and the stuff I've found is truly heart-gagging. Apparently The Dark Lord's hygiene training got lost somewhere in the shuffle. And I gotta' tell ya': typing with rubber gloves is no cakewallk!</p>\n<p>I'm walking today. JG has a theory that my limping is simply a problem of imbalance. She feels certain that if I trash my right knee as badly as the left, voila!, problem solved. We're doing Kohler Mesa and I hope she's right. If you'd like to see science in action, give me a buzz; 2-2672.</p>",

The whole family is there with me, and my grandchildren (or it could be their avatars; with these little <i>bouyam</i>, I can never tell) have just ordered pizza. No one asks if I still like pepperoni.\n\nThe doorbell rings. It's the guy from MortgageWorx. He's here to administer last rites and to let Ronna know she needs to be out by midnight. I pull my head down under my carapace of tangled blankets, and, like a bad PowerPoint, my life flashes before me. Lots of grainy images and indecipherable bullet lists. I try to make sense of it all, but it's difficult because the moron who authored the whole thing used a magenta background and navy blue text. It's horribly confusing, but a few nuggets of truth somehow float to the surface like bubbles in a Lava Lamp.\n\nAnd I know now that there are two life conclusions I <i>will not</i> reach:\n\n\"¢Â I should have watched more television.\n\"¢Â I should have been nicer to Bailey on the Frenzy.\n\nNo me today; talk amongst yourselves. Denny's is still doing that SofSteakâ„¢ lunch special (those clever devils have figured out a way to outsource the heavy chewing) for seniors on their birthdays, and I don't want to miss out. If I get lucky, the staff might come to my table and sing to me in big print.\n\nTomorrow looks to be balmy. I'm thinking a spin down Neva might be fun. E'tu?</p>",

I think you're all \"It should have been me. <i>I</i> should be the one at the helm, not that bootlicking toady Underwood, not that hack Quisling with the fourth-grade vocab and the reaction time of a lobotomized gnu.\"\n\nShows what you know. It turns out this job truly sucks. The workload here is unimaginable. I have to do <i>everything</i> myself. Other than the little Oompa-Loompas down in the mail room, the place is completely unstaffed (SB pinkslipped everyone at the annual Christmas party - a present to himself). The toilets in the main data processing wing are all backed up, and the break room has just been declared a superfund site. To control costs, Bailey has epoxied the thermostats at a permanent 47Â° and all of the cubicles are half-scale. Good grief. On top of that, the accounting firm that cuts the checks is sending out sympathy cards and free ballpoint pens \"until the current crisis passes.\" \n\nMakes me wanna' scream.    \n\nI'll be doing Kohler in the wind today.

I figure that if it's faster than CULink, it's fast enough.\n\nUnless more people start to use it, then I could see it getting moved to another area, like the Bios page. I'll likely continue to use it, mostly because it's a good motivation to get out there and do something (even if it's not a technically a Frenz ride)"

For much of the month of May, these magnificent insects make the first floor men's room their home before moving on to the north in vast nomadic clouds. \n\nFor those with the patience and fortitude to sit quietly and observe, the rewards are great; seeing these awesome creatures scud effortlessly above their kingdom of porcelain and chrome inevitably gives one a lump in the throat and a \"heapin' helping\" of goosebumps. \n\nTours are available. Call (303) 239-4100 for details. \n\nThis is a great experience for young and old alike!"

The year was 1979 and New Hampshire had just been admitted to the union. He was seven that year, and they'd closed the schools so that the children could celebrate. Steve raced straight home on his Sting Ray bike, anxious to mark the occasion in his blog. Though he had even fewer readers back then, the little tyke was determined to keep his posts current. Some things never change.</p>\n<p>Of course, sadly, the next year, Congress realized their mistake - it was Vermont they were after - and New Hampshire soon reverted to its soggy past. Steve remembers the heartache of watching the federal government repossess Interstate 93, one mossy cobble at a time. And when the little burg of Carbuncle Springs, Steve's hometown, tried and failed to sell itself to Canada (for $950 or two working snowmobiles and an 18-inch chainsaw), the grief became as fusty and oppressive as a New England sunrise.</p>\n<p>I'm sure these memories and more will come flooding back as Steve drives home this week for a partially-earned vacation.</p>\n<p>He had just bolted the mooseguards onto the Subaru the other day when I called him to check in.</p>\n<p>\"So are you looking forward to your trip, Steve?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course! I can't wait to dig into my first barbecued marmot. They just don't make it right out here, you know?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm sure. Hey, do you want me to run the Frenzy while you're gone?\"</p>\n<p>\"You won't screw it up like the last time will you? <i>'The Frenzy Swimsuit Issue?'</i> What were you thinking?!\"</p>\n<p>\"Hey, I thought I looked pretty darn good, although, in retrospect, the clogs may have been a bad match. I'll try to do better this time. Any special instructions?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, go easy on iSean. And see if you can spring Stauffer for a ride or two. Tell him you think you may have seen half a bottle of Glenlivet sitting on the curb in the summit parking lot. That usually works; he goes like hell.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okay. Anything else?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, just don't tell anyone we're going to New Hampshire for vacation. I try to keep embarrassing stuff like that private.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sure, trust me.\"</p>\n<p>DU</p>",

    "body":"<div class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh4.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/SvEWMr40jXI/AAAAAAAAB3c/YpioIZjTSxI/s2400/trailer.jpg\" /><br />New Urbanism, New Hampshire style</div>\n<p>New Hampshire and progressive ideas seem to go naturally go together, just like WD40 and phrenology.</p>\n<p>Think \"living off the grid\" is a radical new concept? Well, the folks in New Hampshire have been doing just that for decades. And it's not only the power grid they've left behind; New Hampshire's \"granite heads\" are staying clear of the hygiene and culture grids as well. In fact, the state's residents are at the forefront of the \"Take Back the Darkness\" movement, and they've proven to the world that, with a little Yankee ingenuity, it's still possible to freeze quietly, alone, and in the dark.</p>\n<p>You see, in New Hampshire, \"going green\" means much more than simple food poisoning.</p>\n<p>And what about same sex marriage? Sorry, but that is <em>sooo</em> passé. In New Hampshire, same sex marriage is old hat. Here it's <em>no-sex</em> marriage that's making all the buzz, and experts predict that soon citizens in other parts of the country will be experimenting with refrigerated bedrooms, starched wool long johns, and \"Late Nights with Dave,\" just like New Hampshire's brave sexual pioneers. As an activist recently said at a no-sex rally in the state's capital, \"Why should celibacy end with marriage?\"</p>\n<p>Is the no-sex phenomenon coming to your town soon? If so, you can thank a \"granite head\" who hasn't been there, hasn't done that.</p>\n<p>But don't get the wrong idea. As progressive as the nation's fifty-first state is, it's the old values that still hold sway and help keep folks centered. When your tour guide finally wakes up, ask him to show you the massive stone copy of the Forty-Seven Commandments in Stanley Park, or the site of New Hampshire's first fatal town-council donnybrook in Lintborough (the walleye scaler has been bronzed and is on permanent display!).</p>\n<p>You'll see that the less things change more they stay the same. Or something along those lines.</p>\n<p>One more thing: as a public service, I'm turning the Frenzy over to iSean. Hopefully he can correct the nasty wobble before SB returns.</p>\n<p>Wanna' do Flag today at 11:30? 2-2672</p>\n<p>DU</p>",

The barrage was inescapable, and I found myself wishing James Brown had died (again) instead. I thought he danced w-a-a-y better, and, as a bonus, <i>his</i> sleep-overs were limited to big kids.\n\nCelebs come and go, just like the rest of us, but the feel this week was that <i>we did this to Jocko</i>. <i>We</i> plucked this manboy unceremoniously from his youth and forced him down the same hole Howard Hughes excavated years ago. MJ's attorney said the death came about because Jackson was trying to force his bleached, whittled, 50 year-old body to get up and perform one more time. (Tell me about it; I've spent countless hours doing the same thing, chasing Bailey and Stauffer all the hell over Boulder County, refusing to act <i>my</i> age. Maybe I should try riding with one glove.)\n\nIf only we'd given him some space.\n\nI was sitting at Gate 24 in Austin International and on the TV hanging above, a crowd of mourners was losing the battle for control near a heap of flowers and assorted Michaelabilia. I really was starting to feel the pain when a guy next to me in a CBGB T-shirt said, \"Looks like a sting operation for losers.\"\n\nCold.\n\nYou can discuss this and more today on your ride up SuperFlag w/ iSean.\n\nGive him a buzz.\n\nDU \n</p>",

We got her up, calmed her down, and rolled her back to her car on her walker. Very sweet lady, but when Gunther told her we charge for rescues, she got a little angular on us.

I asked Tom what he thought of my theory that the Marshall Plan was indirectly responsible for the Jonas Brothers. He replied that if I ever <i>did</i> have a legitimate thought, it would be roughly analogous to a BB in a coffee can. I thanked him, and as we chugged on past the Black Swan Mine, I pondered the metaphor. I could tell he really liked me.</p>\n<p>Back in Boulder, before we parted ways, I told Tom that I had a bunch of other ideas about history that I'd like to bounce off him on future rides.

She said she wanted \"a civilized experience,\" which told me the usual Frenz grind, with its attendant drooling and hacking was probably out... at least for now.</p>\n<p>I told her that I knew of a great route out Cherryvale and back through Marshall, one that was both esthetic (my word for goes-past-a-microbrewery) and aerobically challenging. She trusted me - for the last time I'm sure - and we soon found ourselves clanging through a series of cattle gates, tottering over rotting wooden bridges, and wobbling smack into antebellum Boulder County. This would be the area the Open Space guys refer to as the Mosquito Coast, the place they send their rookies to see if they have moxie. They seldom do... or come back.</p>\n<p>I hated telling Kimberly I was lost, but when the elephant is in the room, it's best to give it a peanut. Besides, she'd become suspicious when I mistook a culvert for an underpass (Cripes, there's no <i>headroom!</i> Who designed this damn thing?!). And after we'd passed the same \"CAUTION; DICHLOROETHANE TEST SITE\" sign for the third time, she became decidedly nonplussed.</p>\n<p>\"Hey Dave, mind if I lead for a while?\"</p>\n<p>\"No problem, but let me know if you need help finding the way.\"</p>\n<p>\"I'll be sure to holler. <em>Now move over.</em>\"</p>\n<p>Within five minutes we were back on Baseline and spinning big rings.</p>\n<p>Okay, so she got lucky.</p>\n<p>DU</p>\n<h6>Earlier Today</h6>\n<div class=\"center\"><img src=\"http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/full-metal-jacket-ermey.jpg\" /><br />In the early days, Dave dressed me down daily; the beta-blockers have since calmed him down</div>\n<p>Today Dave wants us to break up into small groups, then report back about what we learned about ourselves.

    "body":"<p><strong>Editor's Note</strong>: Technically, this article was written well-before the first Flagstaff Frenzy post hit newsstands. But, it should definitely live here and see the light of day, so voil&agrave;!</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/zwQa0q9JdiVzPPyZQUbUYQ?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh4.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/St-6GSjjSbI/AAAAAAAAAEA/QxbIt6-h7BE/s2400/P1010001.JPG\" /></a><br />Dave climbing out of \"The Hole\"</div>\n<p>While many of us in ITS grab a slice of pizza at lunch break, Dave Underwood slakes an altogether different type of hunger by jumping on his bike and heading for the hills just West of campus.</p>\n<p>Since 1988 he has made his lunchtime ride a regular routine, dragging himself up to the top of Flagstaff Mountain over 520 times.  To get a sense of what motivates him, I recently skipped lunch and tagged along for the ride.</p>\n<div class=\"left\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3mJL73bh7J6dbZFZ1eG5tA?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh3.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/St-6HNunkXI/AAAAAAAAAEI/14mMBiijvCE/s2400/P1010002.JPG\" /></a></div>\n<p>\"I like hills,\" he confessed with boyish delight as we rode upward at a spirited clip.  \"Never worried much about how far I went, just how much vertical I gained.  I like the drama of climbing.\"</p>\n<p>Struggling to keep up, I was beginning to feel the drama of climbing in my legs, lungs, and throat.  It was a chorus of swelling, painful sensations, so I figured Dave must prefer tragedies to comedies.</p>\n<p>\"It started as training for bike racing, then trail racing.  I never liked working out for my health\"¦seemed too wholesome.\"  After three knee surgeries, with a fourth scheduled soon, Dave is reconsidering the health benefits of regular hill climbs; after 10 minutes riding alongside Dave, I was seriously reconsidering the health benefits too.</p>\n<p>Mercifully, Dave let up a bit as the road tilted back earthward.  Catching my breath, I managed to ask him what his best times were.  \"From the stoplight across from the UMC to the top of Flagstaff Mountain, my best time was 24:57.\"  A truly amazing time, rendered all the more impressive by the fact that he did it pushing big gears\"”his lowest, easiest gear being better suited to cruising around Pearl Street than tearing up Flagstaff Road.</p>\n<div class=\"right\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7hg6y4QcPIaGOflAD2DEfQ?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh5.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/St-6zWX49kI/AAAAAAAAAEk/jbQyeXlRk1U/s2400/P1010003.JPG\" /></a></div>\n<p>As I recovered, I asked Dave whether or not he got tired of the same route everyday.  \"No, the Don Quixote factor is huge for me.  For an hour a day I've got my own lovely little world\"¦and the old guy on the 30lb. mountain bike just ahead of me is Lance Armstrong.\"</p>\n<p>Dave laughs at his vivid imagination but secretly confesses that it is a source of great inspiration.  \"I used to race EVERYBODY.  I'd enter victories in my daily log book as little bikes with an 'x' through them.\"  Needless to say, Dave's thick log book is littered with the x-ed out bikes of cycling's greatest champions.</p>\n<p>But like a great fisherman with stories of ones that got away, Dave has a few stories of big fish he wasn't able to reel in.</p>\n<p>\"So, one day, I see a man and a woman just up the road.  Aha!  Easy victims.  I blow past them, then look over my shoulder and notice it's Davis Phinney and Connie Carpenter [former pro cyclists].  A quarter of a mile later, I'm fried.  They pass me and give me this what-a-moron kind of grin before they disappear.\"</p>\n<div class=\"left\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/x7Ci3ls_r_Txa3aEQKrHUw?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh3.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/St-6IQWKm-I/AAAAAAAAAEQ/Z8hq_KfJ4dw/s2400/P1010005.JPG\" /></a></div>\n<p>When Dave isn't \"competing\" in the Tour de France, his imagination runs wild closer to home.  Indeed, he has named every corner and switchback on Flagstaff Road.  Not surprisingly, the majority of the names have a dispiriting ring: \"Die Lorelei,\" \"A Bridge Too Far,\" \"The Wall,\" \"The Boat Ramp,\" \"The Ledges,\" \"Heartbreak Hill,\" and \"The Snakes.\"  I was hoping we hadn't already passed \"Three Easy Pieces\"\"”the only corner with a pleasant name\"”for I had yet to experience an easy stretch of asphalt.</p>\n<p>Dave has seen a lot in his bike and foot ascents of mountains around Boulder.  On one ride, he was almost beaten up Flagstaff by a guy riding a newspaper bike.  The guy turned out to be an ex-pro rider \"with a twisted sense of fun.\"</p>\n<p>Incredibly, Dave's never had an incident while descending mountain roads on a bike.  He attributes his slalom success to slow speeds and smart riding, which entails leaving \"wiggle room for when a deer jumps onto the road.\"</p>\n<div class=\"right\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/AVwKRmXZyGYfjsaqugZzDA?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh6.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/St-6I6kbJGI/AAAAAAAAAEU/g7iuMb0uuNI/s2400/P1010006.JPG\" /></a></div>\n<p>On trail runs, he's seen a guy sporting a thong, a bear with three cubs, and snow cornices with two inch long ice crystals on Mount Sanitas.  Although he's fallen a lot while trail running, he's climbed much higher than he's fallen&mdash;Dave's done the Pikes Peak Marathon 11 times (once in under three hours) and he's run up Mount Sanitas over 300 times (once in 17:20).</p>\n<p>So, as we finally reached the summit of Flagstaff, I wondered if there was anything that stopped him from climbing at lunch.  \"I hate riding in wet weather; don't mind the cold though.  I've biked Flagstaff in the low teens a bunch.\"</p>\n<p>Even on the soggy days, however, Dave doesn't sit around.  Instead, he heads for 11 storey Gamow tower.  \"I've done it ten times during a lunch break, but I hate it.\"  Indeed, Dave would much rather run trails than walk stairs, even though his knees can't take it anymore.  \"Some of my greatest memories are from days when the temps were below zero and the snow on the trails was untracked.\"</p>\n<p>While he boasts that his motto is \"The older I get, the faster I was,\" Dave is no slouch these days.  Victims still litter his log book, and shattered egos still line the side of the roads around Boulder.</p>\n<div class=\"left\"><a href=\"http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/B5EfTbPttK6y-jhd6QJivw?feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/flagstafffrenzy/image/fetch/f_auto/http://lh5.ggpht.com/_zoD15FRZxcs/St-6J5iCtvI/AAAAAAAAAEY/1QHfhAS8OLc/s2400/P1010007.JPG\" /></a></div>\n<p>The only real uncertainty about Dave is what he actually does eat for lunch; after all, he burns a lot of calories over the course of the day.  His answer is like most any IT stiff's: \"I snack while I work.\"  That's about the only thing we IT stiffs share in common with him though.</p>\n<p>And yet, as we stood atop Flagstaff admiring the Indian Peaks, I felt I did share his passion for climbing.  \"It's poetry,\" Dave allowed.  Though my lungs were still burning, I couldn't agree more.</p>",

Anytime a guy tunnels out to freedom like that, the joy of airy flight is contagious.\n\nIt was a little sad in some ways, though. Like all cons who find themselves suddenly injected back into mainstream society, equipped with a burlappy gray suit and three hundred bucks, Kevin was a little unsure of how to handle himself. The talking crosswalk signs on Broadway scared the beejesus out of him, and Steve and I had to talk him past a gaggle of young ladies up near that big sorority house on University.\n\nOnce he got his sea legs, though, he was fine. As we spun our way up Four Mile, he looked over at me and said, \"You know, I could get used to this.\" Then, seething through clenched teeth, \"I ain't <i>never</i> goin' back!\"\n\nSo, please, <i>please</i> don't tell him he has a meeting today at 11:30. I don't think I could bear to see him crushed like that.\n\nDU"

Naturally, I was more fascinated by their bunker designs and <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?client=opera&q=svalbard&oe=utf-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Svalbard&ll=78.819036,20.214844&spn=5.049863,33.046875&t=p&z=5\">remote locale</a> than preserving seeds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"right\" style=\"margin-top:0.5em;\"><img src=\"http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/seed-vault.jpg\" width=\"150\" /><br />New Frenzy HQ?</div>\n<p>The vault is located 400 feet under the permafrost surface of a sandstone mountain, which should enable it to survive both earthquakes and bomb blasts. The vault may be full of envelopes of seeds rather than precious metals, but that doesn't mean security is lax. Supposedly no single person knows all the codes necessary to gain entrance to the vault. The vault has an array of sophisticated cooling equipment to keep the seeds at -0.4 degrees Fahrenheit, but since the surrounding soil is so cold, even if these artificial measures fail the seeds should remain relatively safe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sounds more and more like <a href=\"http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2007/03/06/sunshine-canyon-ride-report-5\">Frenzy HQ</a>, only I think we need to dig deeper...for security reasons of course.</p>\n<p>Didn't Austin Powers, in a sense, try to preserve seeds this way?</p>",

To honor him, the city has erected many <a href=\"http://www.kaszeta.org/rich/snoopy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snoopy statues</a> around the city.   \n\n6 Loons a laying -- The state bird is the <a href=\"http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=minnesota+loon&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=LFkqS5uZL4WGswOW-ZXNBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQsAQwAA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Common Loon</a>. \n\n5 hours of sun -- It gets pretty dark in Minnesota in the winter and it's cloudy most of the time. Five hours is an exaggeration, though perhaps near the Canadian border it might be seven hours or so during the winter solstice. \n\n4 Fargo jokes -- There's a friendly North Dakota/Minnesota rivalry.\n\n3 salt bags -- Because it's so icy in the winter, people use salt to keep the sidewalks clear. Some people keep a salt bag in their car to melt the snow near their tires in case they are stuck in the ditch.  \n\n2 Ya, You Betchas -- A Minnesota colloquialism for yes. \n\nAnd a giant cherry on a huge spoon -- The Walker Art Center has a sculpture garden which contains a sculpture of a <a href=\"http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.worldofstock.com/slides/AAB1489.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.worldofstock.com/closeups/AAB1489.php&amp;usg=__sTvgZDkbAyyt_crYTEA0irpW7Qg=&amp;h=333&amp;w=500&amp;sz=48&amp;hl=en&amp;start=12&amp;tbnid=K3ZM8f1EfnzlrM:&amp;tbnh=87&amp;tbnw=130&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dcherry%2Bon%2Bspoon%2Bsculpture%2Bminneapolis%26gbv%3D2%26hl%3Den\" rel=\"nofollow\">giant spoon holding a giant cherry</a>."

To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many projects, to want to help everyone in everything is to succumb to the violence of our times. The frenzy of the activist neutralizes his work for peace. It destroys his own inner capacity for peace. It destroys the fruitfulness of his own work, because it kills the root of inner wisdom which makes work fruitful.\""

Frenzy Lifecycle, as originally envisioned by the Founding Fathers</div>\n<p>\nAm I the only one to notice the grotesque sunsetting of this organization in recent months? What once was a lively and vital sounding board of ideas and opinions has settled into the mucky pondbottom of French Existentialist writing and rancid literary meringue. <i>Albert Camus? Jack London? Discussions of good design practices?</i> Seemingly innocent enough at first blush, these pernicious and creeping viruses are the harbingers of doom, the DEW line across which a good blog goes bad.\n\nNot one to passively sit and watch disasters-in-the-making, I've decided to get assertive while SB makes his annual, court-ordered pilgrimage to the clinic in Florida. It's time to take a stand. And knowing how advanced the Frenzy problem has become, I've brought in hired guns from the outside. Using an investigative process known as Managing Information Dependent on Lunatics (MIDOL), this consulting group will study the history of the Frenzy, the Frenzy as we know it today, and the Frenzy as it must appear in order to survive into the future.  \n\nThis process may be painful. Feelings may be hurt. There may even be layoffs. But taking effective steps to salvage organizations in severe decline requires a mix of tough decision-making and singular vision. \n\nIn the next few days, we'll be examining closely what the Frenzy was, is, and must become.   \n\n(I'll be riding east today, looking for some good spinning.

Storing meaningful content in a cool dry place; a key success factor in maintaining the Frenzy life-cycle</div>\n<p>\nI just talked w/ SB on the phone. He's fit to be tied, and it's all my fault; I shouldn't have told him that I've let the efficiency experts rummage through the Frenzy sock drawer. This is a devastating development at this stage of his rehab, and I'm afraid now that the clinic may ask to hold him for an extra few weeks. Send prayers. \n\nNow where were we? Oh yeah... we'd just taken a fresh look at the core Frenzy mission as seen through the <a href=\"http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/02/05/the-frenzy-turns-its-head-and-coughs\">MIDOL</a> lens. As you can see in Figure 2, from its earliest inception, when SB hatched the operation shortly before his first \"hospitalization,\" the Frenzy has run exclusively on garbage. Flowing voluminously both into and out of the Frenzy's administrative shell, garbage is the veritable lifeblood of the blog, but has been historically buffered from any and all meaningful content by a dense layer of raw ignorance.\n\nMuch as the ozone layer protects the earth from the sun's destructive rays, raw ignorance keeps the Frenzy mission intact, and shields end users from the corrosive effects of knowledge.  \n\nIt's this layer that has suffered gravely in recent months, due in part to SB's newfound infatuation w/ <i>The Antioch Review</i>. Even with the introduction of DU (arguably the godfather of ignorance) as a publishing partner, this worsening trend continues, and indeed accelerates. \n\nTomorrow we'll look at possible remedies, including the stopgap hiring of iSean, who is not unlike a Dave Underwood on steroids. \n\nLooks like a good day for Flagstaff; 2-2672\n\nDU \n</p>",

Venn diagram showing the close relationship between the Flagstaff Frenzy and some other stuff</div>\n<p>\nYesterday we told you we would look at several ways in which we might bring the Frenzy back from the brink.  Well, we lied. \n\nThe fact is, it's hopeless. You'd be better off climbing onto the hood of a 2007 Prius on I-70 than you would sticking around this joint. \n\nAfter going through every last byte of small-bore piffle in the Frenzy archives and interviewing (both) Frenzy readers worldwide, our visiting consultants have turned in their resignations and left town. \n\nAll is not lost however. The beauty of the MIDOL process is that, even if left unfinished, the charts, tables, acronyms, and free stuff like pens and tote bags that bob merrily in its wake are of great organizational value. Figure 3, shown above, for example, is a case in point. Even though we here in the Frenzy trenches have no idea what the hell it means, we feel certain that it's something we can act assertively upon and possibly even present at our yearly Frenzy retreat in Brighton.\n\nI can't wait, by the way, until SB returns and I can show him the cool new mouse pads. Anything to cheer the lad up. \n\n(Flagstaff was great fun yesterday, but today it'll probably be too sloppy. I'll likely bike/hike the Four Pines trail; 2-2672 if that strikes you)\n\nDU \n</p>",

Freewheel, the Frenzy guard dog, reacts to SB's homecoming</div>\n<p>\nWell, things are pretty much back to normal here at Frenzy HQ. The efficiency experts have pulled up stakes and moved on. SB is out back shoveling the path to the transmitter, and I'm sweeping the reception area in the unlikely event that we'll have a customer today. \n\nNot that that'll happen. One thing the MIDOL folks have left us with - other than a whopping invoice and a bunch of bright pink, branded schwag - is the certain sense that the Frenzy has grounded hard on the shoals and is going down fast. I'd hoped the experts might show us a clear way out of this mess, but when they all ran screaming from the room yesterday, I started to understand. \n\nAll's not lost, though. I've been toying w/ the idea of starting a blog of my own one of these days (working title: \"Guilt Without Sex\"... or something along those lines), and I know SB is anxious to get back to his noon Sumo classes over at the Rec Center, so here we go... a fresh start never hurt anyone. \n\nBy the way, if you'd like a groovy MIDOL mousepad, come on by... we've got scads of them. \n\nI think Sunshine should be dry today.

I bet he figured the territory around us was marked. \n\nI didn't want Steve to feel bad so I endured that acrid stench for 18 holes, but later I tossed it in the garbage can at the Conoco on Table Mesa and Broadway while I was filling up. It's nice of Steve to get the cleaner from Dave, but I  don't think any amount of cleaner, especially carpet cleaner, would restore that bag to some semblence of normalcy. \n\nOh well, perhaps this is a good sign that it's time for me to give up golf once and for all. I do have a few frisbee golf discs in the trunk. Maybe I'll take up frisbee golf as a hobby. I can probably fit in nine holes over lunch sometime. There's a course down the hill from Steve's luxury condo on in South Boulder. I'll give that course a shot on a sunny warm day this spring. \n\nI guess if Steve comes along, I'll have to watch out for UroDisc (in case they've thought of that for frisbee golfers). \n\nMark."

You wouldn't believe it now, but ol' Steve used to be quite the rake, if you know what I mean. Me and the other guys on the track team used to razz him about dating Suzie Radcliffe and her sister Pam at the same time. He'd turn all red-like and get kind of flustered and threaten to kick our butts on his blog, whatever-the-hell that was. Talked about it all the time. <i>My blog this and my blog that.</i> Made us all wonder if maybe he had a loose screw or something.\n\nBut that was a long time ago, and a lot of water under the bridge. I lost touch with him right after high school. He said when he graduated he was going to France because people there weren't so \"dainty.\" Like we ever complained about his hygiene in the first place! Hell, we <i>all</i> were a little gamey after a big meet, and we really could give a hoot.\n\nLong story short, I followed Steve around for awhile in the papers. There were always stories in the Daily Moosecall, mostly about his troubles with the authorities here and there, and mostly stuff you woudn't want the kids to read.\n\nThen he just flat disappeared... that is until I ran across him here on the Frenzy.\n\nJeez, with the plastic surgery and all, it was hard to tell. Very slick job, whoever did it! But I recognized that old goofy look, though, and he's still wearing the same shirt he had in high school.\n\nWhat really cinched it, though, was the way he savages that poor dumb, SOB Underwood. That's just how he used to talk to Ordy McIntosh. Always putting him down in front of the other kids and giving him wedgies and such.\n\nThat's when I knew it really was him.\n\nSo, Happy Birthday to the eighth fastest miler on the team! (<i>Or was it ninth?</i>) And here's hoping the deal with the statute of limitations in France finally passes muster with Homeland Security. It's gotta' suck trying to explain everything every time you cross the state line.\n\nOh... and Suzie Radcliffe says hi.\n\nEarl Barnes\nPatriot Life and Casualty\nBileborough, NH\n\n(PS; DU is hoofin' today, back on wheels tomorrow)   \n\n</p>\n",

Mercy me, you might just as well be out selling adult books! And the way you talk to that poor Mr. Underwood! Why, I'll just bet he's a very nice man in real life. Shame on you!\n\nSorry if I'm being a bit too hard one one of the nicest guys I ever dated, but I'm just a little shocked. I should make allowances, I guess, given your childhood and that awful, awful experience with the French prison system... And if I'm doing the math right, you're probably still nursing God's-own hangover from your little one-man birthday party yesterday.\n\nSo I apologize for being such a mean old badger.\n\nThere is one thing, though, that's sort of nagging at me.\n\nI want my tapes back.\n\nI do hope you haven't sold them to buy more bandwidth for your little \"hobby\" because I'd give anything to hear \"Ballad of the Green Berets\" right about now. My lumbago is killing me and hearing Barry Sadler singing that beautiful song  would sure cheer me up. Might even bring back some old memories, wink, wink.... like parking down by the peat bog... and cuddling... and looking up at the stars together and hearing you say, \"I wonder if CSS will ever handle rotated text.\"\n\nLordy, you could be so <i>darned</i> romantic sometimes.\n\nLet me know if you need help covering the shipping costs.

Do-Right said Steve was originally facing Interpol charges from carrying bootlegged DVDs across the border and attempting to sell them outside the Walmart at Magog. Fortunately he accepted a plea bargain that allowed him to walk free and assume a new identity. Sgt. Do-Right didn't say much about the DVDs, but he mentioned they were B movies staring Earl Barnes and Suzie Radcliffe. Apparently they were local actors in Bow, NH. \n\nSo welcome back Steve (if that's really your name) and I'm glad you've made it safe back to your office in Berthoud.\n\nDon't worry, your secret's safe with me. :-)"

And this sermon was a doozy; all bile and sputum.\n\nWhen we hit the summit and I'd caught my breath, I reminded him that humor was history, that it was just so much twentieth-century jetsam, and that we were all better off without it. \n\nIt was like showing the periodic table to a cat. Sometimes I don't know why I bother.\n\nThe thing is, I have the same problem at home. The other night at dinner, the oldest cracked a joke as if it were the most natural thing in the world.\n\nI zinged an edamame bean off his forehead, and exclaimed \"<i>What the hell was that??!!</i>\"\n\n\"Jeez, Dad... I was just trying to be funny.\"\n\n\"<i>Funny??!!</i> If it's <i>funny</i> you want, go to one of those places downtown that smells like Lysol and where they don't make eye contact. But don't bring that <i>funny</i> crap into this house, <i>do you understand me, mister?</i>\"\n\n\"Jeez, Dad, don't be so khaki. I was just making a joke.\"\n\nI couldn't believe I had to go through this again. The kid gets good grades, he seems sharp enough in general, but, like I said, he's a lot like Bailey - a heel digger.\n\nI started out slow:\n\n\"What does humor lead to?\"\n\n\"Disrespect?\"\n\n\"Right. And what does disrespect lead to?\"\n\n\"Onanism?\"\n\n\"Nope. You're two steps ahead of me. Disrespect leads to rebellion, remember?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah... and rebellion leads to social decay?\"\n\n\"Right...\"\n\nEt cetera...\n\nI'm sure he'll get it eventually. After all, it makes perfect sense, doesn't it?\n\n<i>Well?</i>\n\nDU"

The rain was coming down so hard, it was next to impossible to drive and winds had to have been sustained at least at 50mph.

Not good.</p>\n<p>The DOW radars began reporting they were detecting a rain-wrapped tornado in our vicinity. Luckily, it was to our east and once the rain and wind died down, we were able to head back and pick up our equipment. We stopped in the hail swatch to photograph some of the stones and even after being on the ground for a while, were still quite large.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Watch for Scott getting pelted by hail on the Discovery Channel.</p>\n<p>Dave and I managed to flee campus a touch early in order to get back for early afternoon meetings.

Very rare beast. And you should see her on the Peak-to-Peak. Oh   my   God.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, nice car, Doc. I'm wondering about this procedure you're going to do, though. I'm a little concerned about a few things.\"</p>\n<p>I'd briefly pierced his reverie. He broke off his shameless slobbering over the car long enough to talk medicine.</p>\n<p>\"Oh yeah, your procedure. Piece of cake. Don't think twice about it. I've done a million of these. Well... four, actually. Enough to pay off the Chris Craft. Do you like mahogany? You should <i>see</i> this boat of mine. Amazing.\"</p>\n<p>\"On your website you said the angio-whatever-you-call-it would give me a forty percent increase in aerobic capacity.\"</p>\n<p>\"We have a website?\"</p>\n<p>\"Yeah, and there's a graph there that shows before and after. It says that after the procedure I'll feel thirty years younger.\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh <i>that.</i> That's a rough estimate. Why the hell do you want to be thirty years younger, anyway? You'll have acne. Say, does that look like oil under my car?\"</p>\n<p>\"No, I think it's just water from the sprinklers.\"</p>\n<p>\"Whew... Now, what were you saying?\"</p>\n<p>\"Look, let's cut to the chase. I ride bikes with these young dudes who beat me up on a daily basis. I only want to go through with this if you can promise me I'll be back in their league.\"</p>\n<p>\"Holy crap! What, do I look like a miracle worker? Maybe you want Mother Theresa. Or a time machine, ha ha.\"</p>\n<p>I could see his attention drifting back to the parking lot again. An elderly woman had just climbed into a battered white Montego parked behind the Alfa. She started the motor and I saw the reverse lights flash on.</p>\n<p>\"Uh oh...\" My cardiologist was rising from his desk.</p>\n<p>I heard her gun the engine a few times and saw a haze of mud-colored smoke belch from the tail pipe. The reverse lights blinked menacingly like the eyes of a dull, but very poisonous reptile.</p>\n<p><i>\"Oh no!\"</i></p>\n<p>The car rocked once.</p>\n<p><i>\"Oh God, please no!\"</i></p>\n<p>Rocked twice.</p>\n<p><i>\"No!\"</i></p>\n<p>And slammed its two full tons of pure Detroit venom backwards into the innocent, doe-eyed Alfa, which shuddered and crumpled pitifully like an empty soda can. The reverse lights went out, and the Montego lurched forward, out of the parking lot and onto Mapleton.</p>\n<p>My doctor, wan and shaking, sank back into his chair. In a wavering voice that was barely audible, I heard him say, \"Yeah, thirty years younger, I guarantee it. My receptionist will schedule it for Wednesday.\"</p>\n<p>I can hardly wait.</p>\n<p>DU</p>",

Part of her job is to give The Talk to home-bound cardio patients, making sure they understand  the \"lifestyle changes\" they'll need to adopt if they want to avoid another toga party in the OR. \n\n<i>Lifestyle changes?!</i>\n\nI took a few notes.\n\n\"So when you drink your coffee in the morning, remember to lift the cup with your knuckles and not with your wrists. Any undo strain could pop your aorta and spray blood all over the couch.\"\n\n\"Loud music will be out now, I'm afraid. Those old Electric Flag albums? Lose them. Remember, you're using replacement veins the size of baby butterfly legs now.. Getting yourself all amped-up on degenerate be-bop music could pop your aorta and spray blood all over the couch.\"\n\nI was sensing a pattern.\n\nI asked her about exercise and, well... you know... <em>s-e-x</em>.\n\nAs a Nurse-Ratched-look turned her face to deep granite, she said, \"The important thing is to just relax and have fun. I'm not trying to scare you. But do bear in mind; any overexcitement could pop your aorta and spray blood all over the couch.\"\nThen, like the aperture petals of an expensive German camera, a perfect origami smile appeared, then vanished, above her porcelain chin. \"Now, do you have any other questions?\"\n\nI'll be doing laps around the Three South nurse's station this morning with my IV stand and a big reflective orange triangle strapped to my butt, case anyone wants to join the fun. Going home later today.\n\n<strong><em>Schlag</em> alert:</strong> Thanks to all my wonderful Frenz for their thoughts, visits, and gifts this week, by the way. Y'all are the best and it's made more difference than you can know. \n\nAlso, say a brief prayer for Herr Bailey. He's back in his hood vacationing, and you know how he gets. (Have fun, Bro!)\n\nDU\n</p>",

He went in for a stress test because of the ongoing \"vapor lock\" episodes he was having, and they found his arteries were 90% blocked (which of course made him brag that he's been riding at 10% of his real capacity, and will thus kick our butts when he recovers).\n\nAnyhow, they signed him up for bypass surgery the following day, and he's doing well now. But, it'll be a while before he can ride again. Looks like we'll be doing Frenzy walks for a while.\n\nHope all's well with you! When will you be in town? Soon, as I recall....\n\n-Steve"

Today was of course the <a href=\"http://www.deercreekchallenge.com/\">inaugural Deer Creek Challenge</a>.</p>\n<p>I was very disappointed to learn that the beer would only be available at the end of the ride. I believe I was misled&mdash;I genuinely thought this was a pub crawl.</p>\n<p>The ride itself (the century) was 106 miles with 12,741 elevation climbed and is touted by the sponsors as the toughest century ride in the US. I think it might be the toughest purely due to the pizza&mdash;I saw almost as much of it on the side of the road as I did in the boxes!</p>\n<p>It was an interesting ride for me because my Garmin decided to play tricks with me and fail to report elevation accurately. As a result I was under the impression I had almost 4k feet of climbing still to do right up until I hit about 90 miles and realized that reality was just not possible given the remaining mileage and course.</p>\n<p>The event itself was very well run and I would recommend it!</p>\n<p>Now back to the beer!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I shouldn't feel so bad about truly riding my couch this weekend. I mean, hey, I did go fetch the mail.</p>",

Matthew has a ready excuse for being destroyed like a cheap plastic trinket by Greg. Is his excuse valid? Have you heard it before? How many times?
