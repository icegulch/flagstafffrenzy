Dear Dave,

My problem is simple. My daughter wants to be a graphic designer. Frankly, if she goes down that path, I don't know how I can possibly explain it to family and friends. I've tried reasoning with her, but her mind is made up.

Any suggestions? I'm&#8230;

Dear Tearing Your Hair Out In Gunbarrel,

Remember those gritty, ginned-up &#8220;scared-straight&#8221; documentaries they made back in the eighties? The ones where they had kids who'd been convicted of, say, shoplifting a roll of Lifesavers or riding their bikes on the sidewalk spend a day with a convicted murderer in the state pen?

_&#8220;You know, there's nothing I'd like more than popping your head like an overripe kiwi, you scrawny little milk-faced ratwhisker.&#8221;_

&#8220;Thank you, sir. I love how you've decorated your cell.&#8221;
I think the same treatment might be called for here. As unpalatable as this sounds, you'll need to have a graphic designer come spend an evening at your house. Remember, this is your child's life we're talking about, so sit back down, quit whining, and grow a set.

Before you let a designer into your home, though, there are a few things you should know:

- Designers were born thirsty. Make sure it has plenty to drink. Avery's IPA should do the trick.
- Have colorful, primitively-shaped foam or plastic objects on hand. Designers tire quickly of what we call &#8220;conversation,&#8221; and feel compelled to do something inherently useless with their hands.
- Designers are notorious chewers. Keep valuables locked securely away in another room.
- If it wants to talk about &#8220;white space&#8221; or the &#8220;rule of thirds,&#8221; by all means let it. This is precisely the sort of cortex-gagging nonsense your daughter needs to hear. Swallow hard and encourage it to carry on.
- It will probably need more beer than that.

Even though this will undoubtedly be one of the more painful evenings of your life, you can rest assured that, after a few hours' exposure, your daughter will never again gush shamelessly over Helvetica Neue Ultralight or refer to Adobe Illustrator as a &#8220;cool place to hang out and make swirly stuff.&#8221;

I know this seems like using chemo-therapy for a runny nose, but, trust me, this is nothing you want to fool with.

FYI, your letter may mark a new low point in my career. I'm actually thrilled to have it behind me.

Dave
