I think this video's funny because the guy seems so ticked off at the wind

Too bad K-No couldn't join us today. Dave and I found the temperatures and lack of clouds quite a pleasant change to yesterday's craziness.

The usual [frost pocket](http://www.komotv.com/weather/asksteve/4347556.html) was not detectable at the base of Sunshine Canyon, and there were some tailwinds pushing us uphill. What a treat! We were so jazzed that we shimmied our way down Poorman and gingerly avoided the traffic stream in Boulder Canyon. Great day.

Wow, I set myself up for some smack talk today! Read Dave's [gut-busting comments](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2007/12/05/sunshine-canyon-ride-2#comment-572) on my whiny post below.

###### Steve's Wednesday Whining

> As an aside, I don't feel bad about not riding yesterday afternoon. The ride home last night more than made up for it! Because the darn RTD bike rack was full, I resigned myself to pedaling home at about 6pm. With winds [squarely out of the west](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&t=p&om=1&msa=0&msid=106412931864288195098.0004408c993b86bf89ea2&ll=39.97245,-105.255632&spn=0.055055,0.125999&z=14&iwloc=0004408cc1a82ff9ad6b8) at 25-30mph, gusting to 55mph, it was often a battle to remain upright. The stretch along [Greenbriar leading up to Fairview High](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&t=p&om=1&msa=0&msid=106412931864288195098.0004408c993b86bf89ea2&ll=39.97245,-105.255632&spn=0.055055,0.125999&z=14&iwloc=0004408c9d848253bec70) reminded me of the wind tunnel at NCARâ€”the force of the wind was steady enough that you could simply plug away and deal with it. However, where [Greenbriar bears left at Fairview](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&t=p&om=1&msid=106412931864288195098.0004408c993b86bf89ea2&ll=39.97245,-105.255632&spn=0.055055,0.125999&z=14&iwloc=0004408cb3474c5b988e8), the crosswinds were atrocious. At one point it took everything I had (and I was on my 40lb truck) to keep from being pushed from the bike lane into traffic. I figure I was pushed about 15ft from the curb.

This won't be the last whining you hear from me!
