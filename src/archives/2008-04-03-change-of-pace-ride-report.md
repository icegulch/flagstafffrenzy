Flagstaff was wicked cool today. Ragged little clouds, waves of grain snow hopping on the pavement like popcorn, and nobody around. I love how a little weather scares people off. I missed having SB and K-No along though; their effortless chatting about work while I hork my lungs is always comforting.
