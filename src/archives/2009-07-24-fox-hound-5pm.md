Saw Danielson again on my way home yesterday; apparently, he's in real good shape!

So, gather ye chalk-sticks while ye may. Today is fox/hound.

Adriana and iSean are foxes, and the rest of us are hounds. Hounds should gather at the Humanities building at 5pm (Norlin Quad side of the building). See you then!

###### Wasted Report

Between the two of us, Dave and I shed 20lbs on today's ride up Lee Hill - Lefthand - Old Stage. I was not feeling good. This weather is for the birds.
