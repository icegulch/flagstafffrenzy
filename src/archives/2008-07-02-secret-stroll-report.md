Sometimes I think Dave is my own personal Sgt. Doakes...

I got really swamped this morning, so I didn't have time to post anything. Fortunately for me, however, the astute Dr. Lenski rung me up and said: Get off your keester! We're riding!! And so I did.

We spun out Marshall, Cherryvale, and Baseline Roads, reeling in and passing folks with spirit-crushing speed. Subsequently, several ambulances were called to fetch the shattered remains of egos from the side of the road.

Good thing too, as those egos really get ripe in this heat.
