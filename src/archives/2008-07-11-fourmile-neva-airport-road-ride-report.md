Cavs and I agree: bring back the Coors Classic!

Sean Pease broke a record on today's ride, but unfortunately it wasn't the hour record or something else. No, poor guy had four or so flats.

Still it was great to get out, despite the darn heat and dry windâ€”relative humidity currently: 4%!!! Cavs also joined today's proceedings, and he reminded me that I have no business even pretending to sprint.

Thanks for coming today, guys! Have a good weekend, everyone.
