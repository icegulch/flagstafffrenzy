The Gammonizer suggested this one. I liked [this one](http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/video/clips/mark-wahlberg-talks-to-animals/727504/) too.

Glancing at the forecast, I'm afraid I'm going to run out of superlatives for the clement weather by Thursday. Suggestions?

Anyhow, Rob and Dave joined me for a wonderful stroll up Linden Drive. Lots of steady climbing, followed by steep descending.

Rumor has it a certain man of classical tastes might tag along tomorrow. Dave's advice to us: Take him on something hard. Will do, my friend. Shout out to the Gunthernator from us.
