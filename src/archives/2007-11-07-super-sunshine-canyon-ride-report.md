The weather's nice now, but [windstorm season](http://www.bcna.org/images/wind_bymonth.gif) is just around the corner

Dave may have forgotten that one of my favorite prefixes is "super", which I tagged onto our Sunshine Ride today. Fantastic weather and unbeatable company!

As per K-No's request, tomorrow's ride will be a flat one. Friday let's take a crack at _Criminal Intent_.
