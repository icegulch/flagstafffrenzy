One of my favorite works of visual design (from [Thinking with Type](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-Critical-Designers-Students/dp/1568984480) by Ellen Lupton)

I'm back! Prepare yourself for an overabundance of [vacuous inanities](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2008/08/19/orienting-new-people#comment-817).

Dave's right (about something for a change): there's a hint of fall in the air! Fourmile canyon had a gentle refreshing breeze, some leaves hinted at turning soon, and the light is slightly different, as Dave observed. Can't wait.

Not much else to report. Dave didn't show any visible signs of disgust with my rambling observations. But, come to think of it, he did have earplugs in; either that or Dick Cheney was feeding him pat responsesâ€”a testament to Dave's inability to think or speak for himself.
