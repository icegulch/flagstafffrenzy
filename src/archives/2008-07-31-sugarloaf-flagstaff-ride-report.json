      "body": "My take on Burton's latest? Go ahead, twist my arm. Helo Dunkers? Redneck Parasailing? Paddycake in a G-suit? Did Burton join the Air Force or Phi Kappa Phi? When is the Slip 'N Slide on Quaaludes scheduled? Right after Yager Night in the flight sim? God forbid the Russkies should launch the big one while America's finest are executing flawless &quot;weenie rolls&quot; on the 14th green. It's like &quot;Jackass, the Movie&quot; with an eighty-billion dollar budget. I'm just thankful YouTube wasn't around back at Normandy: &quot;Here's my pal Jason lighting farts on the beach. Yeah, those look like real tracers, but we added 'em in last night with iMovie's new Combat Effects plug-in.&quot; Does Al Quaeda watch this stuff? &quot;If you see the American Devil paragliding over the motherland, aim at the trailer hitch. But, remember: I have first dibs on his iPod.&quot; Lord help us all. (Just kiddin' Matt... You're doing great!)"
