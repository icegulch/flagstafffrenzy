If you find yourself in NH this evening, watch my dad [play some folk music](http://www.meetup.com/4-Seasons-Hiking-Group/calendar/11873479/) at _The Grange_

Since Dave had a 1pm meeting, he asked if we could move up our start time by half an hour. I happily obliged—and updated the blog accordingly—but sorry if you were waiting for us at 12:10p.

Anyhow, we really did sashay this afternoon, chewing the fat up to Seven Hills Road, whereupon we turned around and headed home.

The Sunshine "icebox" is living up to its reputation, sporting a thin patina of black ice that made me ultra nervous on the descent, mostly because I'm still gun-shy from my spinout the other evening.

###### Happy Birthday, Deb!

If you see Deb today, you might want to wish her a Happy Birthday! Officially, her big day is Monday, but she'll be out of town, so get your shots in while you can.

###### This Just in...

Brian, our own fixie cyclocross hero, passed this along. Thanks, Brian!

  
I think I've heard these guys on the "WB" radio channel in my car

Great Friday fare, Brian! I need to break out my tight jeans.

###### And This Just in from Mark

Apparently, Mark has returned from his retreat in Snowmass. He passed along this 9News video featuring the monastery:

  
Mark has been spending his time in [quiet contemplation](http://www.9news.com/news/article.aspx?storyid=124444&provider=top)

We look forward to having our zen master back. Please, no jedi mind tricks on us, though, Mark.
