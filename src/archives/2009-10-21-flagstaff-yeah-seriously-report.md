Some photos from today's snowy ride

Dave repeatedly reminded me that "this is the kind of ride that separates the men from the [Stauffers](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2009/10/21/flagstaff-yeah-seriously#comments)" today.

Really, though, it wasn't that bad. It was snowing most of the time, which meant our clothes stayed drier. There were no other bikers and only a few cars.

The combination of fog and snow was splendid. The sun tried to peek through a number of times, but I'm glad it didn't. I only had my clear "sunglasses."

Upon returning to campus, I went to unbuckle my helmet and realized it had been unbuckled for some time. Not sure how long. Suppose that's one of my nine lives.
