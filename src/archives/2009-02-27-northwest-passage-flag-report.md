I feel like I dipped my fingers in these waters. Frigid descent!

Well, today, once again, we bailed on our intended course. The winds were too high and too shrill for heading north, so we stuck close to home and bagged Flag.

We were joined by Cavs, James (from Regent), and Julian, which raised the total value of our bikes from $1020 to $10200 (conservative estimate). Seriously, it was good to have company. Thanks for tagging along, gentlemen!

Now it's time to thaw my fingers. Please excuse any typos. Bon weekend!!
