Mount Elbert hike [gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/icegulch14/MountElbertHike?feat=directlink); no wonder my legs are sore.

Well, the brooding clouds _almost_ scared me off, but not quite. Indeed, I rode into the belly of the beast this noonday and re-emerged a changed man.

Just kidding. Actually, it started raining at Crisman, and by the time I was in Salina it was a steady rain and noticeably cooler. Luckily, I had brought my brand new wind vest, which is white and now somehow has grease on it(!!), so the trip down was comfortable.

Still lots of pain in my quads and calfs from yesterday's hike. All those unused stabilizer muscles, I guess. Sounds like I might activate them again this weekend with some type of Divide run. Interest?
