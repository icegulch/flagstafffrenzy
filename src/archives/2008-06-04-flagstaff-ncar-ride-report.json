      "body": "JG and I did a variation on the Poorman duathlon; High Ho Silver, a newly discovered summit just south of the upper pipecut saddle. I don't think it's ever been climbed, and doing it w/out oxygen was especially satisfying. We left fixed ropes for the next party. On the way back to campus, J [hit](http://www.weldreality.com/image-car-wreck-3.gif) a '97 Camaro w/ her bruiser - I mean cruiser - bike. Holy cow. J claimed she didn't feel a thing."
