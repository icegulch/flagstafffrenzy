This is Dave's brain...this is Dave's brain on drugs. Scientists have failed to find a difference.

No, seriously, Mark passed along an article entitled [Dead Fish Lights Up When Shown Pictures of Humans](http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Dead-Fish-Lights-Up-When-Shown/8130/) recently. In all honesty, I wasn't surprised. Dave's brain has given false positives for the past five years.

###### Ride Report

Ah, what a day! Dave, you would've loved it: overcast, slightly humid but not rainy, and snow falling just off [in the distance](http://webcam1.eldora.com/axis-cgi/jpg/image.cgi?resolution=640x480) at the summit. There was a light rain/sleet on the descent but no snow, unfortunately. I've begun [dreaming about](http://www.intellicast.com/Travel/Weather/Snow/Cover.aspx) groomed nordic tracks!

Indeed, it was a splendid ride. The faces I saw on the way up and down were the same familiar faces one sees year-round, particularly in the winter months when the snow-birds spin on their trainers.

Kindred spirits!

Speaking of which, send positive thoughts to Adriana this afternoon, as she's slated to have a root canal. Do you think she'll be in a good mood when I pick her up?
