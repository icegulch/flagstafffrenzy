Much as I like winter and cold and sliding off the road on gravel and ice and frostbite and having your skin dry out till your face feels like jerky and having your lungs burn as the ice crystals shave the cilia down to bare metal and losing the feeling in your fingers for days at a time, days like this are pretty dadgum nice."

Actually, I couldn't make the late start time due to afternoon meetings, so I went out early and had a nice ride down Cherryvale Rd. to Marshall."
