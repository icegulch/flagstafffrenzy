The Bailey Thule cargo box did not fare well in "The Garage Incident"

This weekend, I decided to try patching the Thule cargo box Adriana drove into our garage door at 40mph (while backing out).

McGuckins had some amazing apoxy that sealed not only the cracks but also my left ring and pinky fingers (call me "The Claw" from now on).

Now I just have to go to Super Rupair in North Boulder and replace the mangled roof-rack crossbar.

So, if you'd like to join me on this mission, with slight detours up some of the steeper ramparts in town, gather at Humanities @ 12p. I'll be riding the truck.

###### Kudos to Adriana

True, I do talk smack about her above, but I'm still very proud:

This development now serves as a challenge to Dave's motto for us: "None of us is dumber than all of us." What to do?
