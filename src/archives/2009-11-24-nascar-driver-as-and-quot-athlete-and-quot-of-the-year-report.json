      "body": "Oh my God! The lady on the ATV; that's Annie Matson! I haven't seen her in years. Still fit as a fiddle, I can see. I met Annie back when I was in training for the Kraft Cracker Barrel 500. In fact, she mentored me in a fashion, helping me work out the bugs with my double-clutching - I was awful from 3rd to 2nd - and showing me how to pick the best line through the hay bales. Over cigarettes and Colt 45's after one particularly tough workout, I asked her what the biggest challenge had been in her rise to the top: &quot;I'd have to say it was learning how to remember left from right. My coach used to yell, 'turn left, then go fast, then turn left and go fast again,' but I'd get it all messed up and smack into the old Korn Dog stand at the end of the straightaway. That's when we came up with the remotely-controlled electrodes idea. As you know, it revolutionized the sport... and we never got squat.&quot; &quot;Yeah, I always thought you guys got a bum deal. But tell me, Annie: how do you stay in such great shape, you know, holding up to the rigors of track life, race after race, year after year?&quot; &quot;Oh, this?&quot; she said, playfully woggling the rolls of fat that erupted from every seam in her purple Tyvek driving suit, &quot;Kentucky Fried and Fox News, pretty much every day, unless I'm feeling poorly, then I cut back on the Fox News a bit.&quot; &quot;Wow, that sounds hard.&quot; &quot;Gets worse: three days a week I do a two-hour session with my bowling coach, Steve Bailey. The man is a human pizza chipper. Just trying to keep up makes me dizzy. Very effective, though. You should give him a call, he has openings.&quot; I truly did give it some thought, but, as much as I love competitive driving, I _do_ have my limits. Now where did I put that Baby Ruth? DU"
