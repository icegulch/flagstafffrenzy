I think EndoSean had one too many mints before today's ride

Doctor Lenski joined the gang today on the gentle slopes of NCAR hill, forcing a grueling pace that had EndoSean talking to Ralph on the big white phone (not a new [3GS iPhone](http://www.apple.com/) either).

Just when we thought the torture was over, Noel said "How about another lap?" Since Dave borrowed our shared brain for some yard work at home, I happily obliged.
