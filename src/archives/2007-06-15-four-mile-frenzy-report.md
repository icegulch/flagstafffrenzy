Blast furnace upslope winds make the descents almost as hard as the climbs

Wow! Hot out there today!! It was the kind of day we used to dread while fighting fires out West. Thanks to Matt and Rob for braving the elements with me.

Only three more work days until I split for Vancouver. You'll start to see some new Frenz posting for the next month or so. Don't worry, though. A month goes by fast in the summer. (Steve)
