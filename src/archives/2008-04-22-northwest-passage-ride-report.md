Thanks to all the clowns who carpet-bombed my office yesterday after work. No wonder Greg was so antsy for me to leave: You should go home, Steve. No, really! Also, thanks to everyone for my funny card!

Northwest Passage was great today, though it was drier than one would expect for spring. Still, Dave, Rob, Adriana, and I managed to avoid any embarrassing bike rollovers. The weather nowadays is perfect! Hope to see y'all tomorrow.
