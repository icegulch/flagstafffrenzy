      "body": "I actually have the Shepard Family's CD (_Bad to the Wishbone_) and it's a stone shaker. As kickass as it is, though, I actually have a rough time listening to it because it brings back some hideous memories from one of their shows. I should let the past be the past, but, honestly, it's not as if you can totally ignore the photo, bottom left, on page 47 of the August 1928 Rolling Stone. I'm not that limber anymore, and I think that's good. DU"
