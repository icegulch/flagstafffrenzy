Flood [damage](http://www.nps.gov/mora/parknews/images-of-the-flood-of-2006.htm) was one of the reasons we had to abandon the trail

Speaking of floods, we encountered a rare downpour on the ride back from Flagstaff this afternoon. Adriana, Matt, and I persevered nevertheless.

Sounds like Dave has overdone his EPO injections, so we'll have to welcome him back down the road.

Thanks for taking good care of the Frenzy while I was gone!
