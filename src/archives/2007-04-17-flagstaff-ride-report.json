      "body": "Johnny Lee Miller and Billy Boyd together in the same movie?!! At last?!! Wow! And we thought &quot;The Departed&quot; was star-studded, eh? I haven't seen the movie, but I think the trailer might actually be longer. Could be a first. I don't think a bike movie will really do that well in today's market; a little thin on flames and such. Maybe if they put cards in their spokes and lighter fluid in their handlebars? Is there an evil Russian? How does this all relate to 9/11? If I was doing their marketing I might want &quot;Adam Sandler does NOT appear in this film&quot; right out front... Couldn't hurt. We should organize a Frenz Field Trip to go see it when it hits the multi. Oh... no, wait a sec... I'm busy that day."
