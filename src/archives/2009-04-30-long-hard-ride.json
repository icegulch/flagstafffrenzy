Doesn't bug me in the least that he sends out these toothless screeds on a regular basis, clicking away at his Barbie-blue laptop from deep within his bower of silk pillows and Cointreau bon-bons. I'm tough; bring it on, baby! I'm thinking three laps of Scott Carpenter today, in low gears. Any joiners? DU"

(Their projects are due tomorrow: Oh-my-God-why-didn't-anyone-warn-us!!??) As soon as Tim shows, I'm away for a ride. But it may be well after noon. Sean, when are you leaving? DU"
