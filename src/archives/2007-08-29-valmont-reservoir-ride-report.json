      "body": "I didn't know I had a typical fashion. I had a meeting that went until a little after noon, so I couldn't meet you all at 12:05. As for going the opposite direction, it makes for a better ride. By extending the route east to 95th, coming back on Valmont and taking the boulder creek path back to campus, I avoid most of the traffic and get in a pretty good ride (19 mile-ish)."

I really can't recall at this point in time. Did I take a dip in Boulder Creek after the alleged ride? I can't remember... It's hard to recall now. Can you repeat the question? (Sorry Frenz, but I hear there's an opening in the Attorny General's office and I'm just practicing for the interview. Wish me luck!)"
