Drafting behind this crew was a dream! Like swimming with the current in Hurricane Bill

Wow! What a great cast today!!

Joining Dennis on the spin sendoff were: Julian, Nick, Hideo, Greg, Rob, Kevin, DU, Cavs, and moi. I think I actually pedaled once during the whole tour, thanks to "the tall guys."

We all wish Dennis good luck in his next great adventure. As a preview, Dennis sent us his to-do list for Tuesday, September 8th (his first day of real retirement):

> *   sleep in
> *   chew and enjoy breakfast
> *   ride 26 miles, while daydreaming
> *   yoga
> *   shoot 9 holes of golf
> *   go to grilling class with daughters
> *   make plans to repeat without forgetting water cooler duty on Wednesday

Ambitious, if you ask me. Thanks to everyone for joining the fun today!
