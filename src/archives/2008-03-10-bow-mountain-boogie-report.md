This is a great ad from the UK

Dave and I danced the Bow Mountain Boogie this afternoon, and while our skillz on the dance floor are questionable, at least we got out there and cut a rug.

Little bit of mud at the top of Roubaix Row, where only the inimitable Greg "Power" Stauffer can make it with his TT bike. Otherwise, smooth, mudless sailing.

Dave says we're doing intervals behind the Rec Center tomorrow. Sounds like a shady place for a workout, if you ask me. I mean, how do you avoid cutting your hands on all those broken beer bottles Dave left down there?!
