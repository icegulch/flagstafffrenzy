We conquered the dreaded [Northwest Passage](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/routes#northwest) today without the use of banned substances. Actually, that's a little bit misleading, as rumor has it Kevin's been working with Ricardo Ricco's _preparatore_:

> RiccÃ² also uses the services of controversial masseur Roberto Pregnolato who was Pantani's soigneur. Pregnolato was found guilty in possession of drugs and trying to get rid of them during the _blitz_ at the Giro in 2001. He's not my preparatore (trainer), he only gives me massage sometimes; he's from Modena and he's a good masseur, Ricky acknowledges. \[[CyclingNews](http://www.cyclingnews.com/road/2007/giro07/?id=/riders/2007/interviews/riccardo_ricco_giro07)\]

Enough with the rumors, though. Everyone should wish Mark a Happy Birthday, as tomorrow is his big day!
