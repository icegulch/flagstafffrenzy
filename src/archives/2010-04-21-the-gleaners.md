Hey Maritia, you missed a really good one over here!

I noticed the extra attentiveness paid by the grounds crews this morning as they worked the Quad. The little 4/20 tweakers left the field quite the mess yesterday, and today's clean-up appeared to be taking place w/ surgical precision. Hmmm... I'm headed up Four Mile at 11:30 today. Buzz me if you're game - 2-2672. DU
