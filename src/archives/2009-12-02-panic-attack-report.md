It's official: **nothing** stops Dave from riding ([view gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/DaveRidesFlagInDeepSnow))

I'm speechless and guilt-ridden. After seeing Dave's [ride pix](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/DaveRidesFlagInDeepSnow) from today, I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't ride to work because the hill I have to descend is "too steep when icy". Yes, that's the tiny hill on Greenbriar.

I suppose there are also freshly-licensed teens driving to high school that I have to contend with, but still, such pitiful excuses ring fatuous in view of Dave's escapades. I'm not worthy!

Hollywood just offered this YouTube director $1M and a $30M budget to direct his film (courtesy of MarkG)

Maybe we should get an HD camcorder and beef up our AfterEffects skills.
