Another JD commercial by the _Brand New School_. Not as good as [the first](http://www.youtube.com/watch#!v=YEm77vwz6-8), which is one of my all-time faves.

The deluge has yet to begin, which meant Rob and I were able to get out and ride Poorman.

It's a little cooler than yesterday but still short-sleeve weather. One benefit of riding in the pre-summer storm hours is great tailwinds blowing up the canyons, making one feel light and airy. Or maybe that was the car fumes.

Tried out Leonards Road right after climbing the Poorman steep pitch. It'd be so fun to find a passage back to Sunshineâ€”a passage that wouldn't entail gunfire.
