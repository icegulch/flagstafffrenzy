Okay, enough of this Frenzy prattle. If you want to read a **real** blog, check out some very cool info on climate response strategies written by yours truly, live from summer school in Switzerland: [cires.colorado.edu/blogs/what-next](http://cires.colorado.edu/blogs/what-next/).

And, because it's so good, you might as well read it again at [ThinkSwiss](http://thinkswiss.org/brainstormblog/). ThinkSwiss is actually my sponsor for this grand adventure and incredible learning opportunity. So be sure to click their link several times.

Beautiful photos of the Alps, forthcoming!
