Oh, let's hope not!

Steve's write-up after Tuesday's ride on Flagstaff had this image of Beloki's crash replaying in my mind. I'm hoping that posting it here will help cleanse my mind.

I'm afraid that duty calls today in the form of a project update meeting for me. I believe Kevin also has the same commitment. If anyone is planning to ride, please post your plans in the comments and take plenty of water with you. The shaded slopes of Fourmile Canyon might be a good bet today.
