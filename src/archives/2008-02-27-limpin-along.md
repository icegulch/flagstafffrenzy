Hopefully when I take my bike in, they won't do this kind of "tune up"

Thanks to Mr. Myers for the above video! Saw a guy riding a slightly shorter version during Boulder's notorious "Thursday Night Cruiser Ride" last year.

The Cannondale and "truck" are on their last legsâ€”high time for a tune up. I'll try to make it out one more time on Flagstaff today, but don't join us if you're looking for a quiet ride. Gather at 12:15p @ Telecom.

By the way, I bailed on Initiation yesterday.
