      "body": "Ever since Lance Armstrong made &quot;testicular&quot; a household word, Americans have avidly followed bike racing. Me too. Thus it was, when perusing the cycling news section in the Denver Post (hint; it's just south of the section devoted to water wrestling), that I noticed our own lovely and talented Steve Bailey will be racing in this weekend's Bob Cook Hillclimb, otherwise known as the Race to the Troposphere. How exciting. I'm anxious to see how SB does. While it's true that Steve is a true scrapper, he's no common schoolyard pug, nosiree Bob. He may be fiercely competitive, but he's also habitually analytical and deeply thoughtful, which is to say he cheats. It'll be interesting to see what happens when the 30cc of HGH2 kicks in. The guy he bought it from assures him that it's well-buffered, and that the shakes and blurred vision shouldn't present that much of a problem. The stuttering could be an issue though, but it usually goes away in 3 - 5 days. (Please don't tease him next week.) If Steve can hang onto the handlebars and if the hallucinations don't invite him to the All-U-Can-Eat pizza buffet just over that cliff, he should do quite well, possibly even finishing in the top 90 percent. Let's all wish him good luck! My wheel is still getting fixed, so I'm on foot again today."
