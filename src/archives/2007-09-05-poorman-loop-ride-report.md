Not sure what punctured Greg's tube today, but am sure he didn't use his "decision tree" before riding with us

Well, when Greg shows up for rides, it's always a good time. Poor guy had not one but TWO flats today on [Poorman Loop](http://www.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=Pleasant+St+%26+Macky+Dr,+Boulder,+CO+80302&daddr=university+and+6th+ave+boulder,+co+to:arapahoe+and+4th+st+boulder,+co+to:fourmile+canyon+and+poorman+rd,+boulder,+co+to:mapleton+and+4th+st+boulder,+co+to:mapleton+and+4th+st+boulder,+co+to:6th+and+university+boulder,+co+to:6th+and+university+boulder,+co+to:6th+and+university+boulder,+co+to:pleasant+st+and+macky+dr+boulder,+co+to:pleasant+st+and+macky+dr+boulder,+co&layer=&sll=40.024755,-105.327902&sspn=0.016103,0.030899&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=13).

After the second flat, we hopped a train and hoboed our way back to town. We met a nice fella on the train who convinced us both to forsake our earthly belongings and take to the spiritual life. We had to walk back to town in our boxers.

To punctuate our fun ride, my front tire slowly deflated upon our return.
