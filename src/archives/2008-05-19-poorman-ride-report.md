Well, it suddenly feels like summer. Bloody warm. If it hadn't been for a few thin clouds fighting off the sun, Greg and I would've cooked on upper Poorman. (Personally, I can't wait until fall.) Other than the muggy weather, it was a great ride today. Poorman is fairly passable, i.e., packed down and clean, right now.
