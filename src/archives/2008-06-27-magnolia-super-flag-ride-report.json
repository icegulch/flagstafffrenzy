      "body": "I'd like to do Magnolia one of these days, but I have a 1pm meeting. Despite my infrequent Frenzy appearances of late, I haven't been totally neglecting the bike - I've ridden Old Stage twice this week after work. Fortunately, I didn't run into any [bears](http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2008/jun/24/injured-cyclist-watch-out-bears/)."

      "body": "Well that was easy. My surgery was a piece 'o cake, and my doctor tells me my subclavicular vein is flowing along like the Autobahn now. All good news. The yellow caution flag is still up, though, for at least another week, i.e., I'm under a few restrictions... 1. No lifting anything over 400 pounds above my head. I think I can do that. 2. I have to closely watch my alcohol intake. Not a problem; I can drag a chair right to the mirror before popping a cold one, though I can't imagine how this could be therapeutic. 3. No swimming in Boulder Creek. Though they stuffed me full of antibiotics before they sewed back up, there's a chance that anything downstream of Eban Fine could take me out. 4. I'm to avoid my mother-in-law's meatloaf. (I'm lobbying to make this one permanent.) 5. This one sucks: no biking. My surgeon specifically mentioned my &quot;n'er-do-well buddies from the Frenzy.&quot; She said they had &quot;about as much collective sense as a sea cucumber,&quot; and that riding with them would void the warranty. What a lightweight. Sooo... It looks like I'm earthbound again for awhile. That means Kohler Mesa, Kohler Mesa, Kohler Mesa, Kohler Mesa, Kohler Mesa, I s'pose. Sheesh."
