Let's not be a [nation of wusses](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5960674) today

Speaking of wusses, Dave is hosting an office-warming party at his new digs in ATLAS. Please RSVP at 2-2672.

Though we certainly could use more office parties, Mark also proposes more [office music videos](http://www.hulu.com/watch/180339/the-office-the-office-cold-open), Ã  la _The Office_. Can I be Creed?

Not sure we'll be able to slip out on wheels before it really starts to snow, so we may be hiking today. Stay tuned.
