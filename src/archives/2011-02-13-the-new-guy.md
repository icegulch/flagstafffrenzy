Wonder if I'll get beat up and have my lunch money stolen.

Think we missed Greg last Friday, but Dave and I managed to enjoy the warm conditions on Initiation just the same.

There's more banana-boat weather on the way too. If you can get out this week, you should! Zeiler said he'll be out on Wednesday showing off his new Felt bike.

Hope there'll be snow for this Saturday's [moonlight skiing/snowshoeing](http://www.eldora.com/nordic.event.php?action=monthly&year=2011&month=2) at Eldora.
