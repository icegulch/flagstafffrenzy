Rode the truck in this morning with the hope of getting out today. Unfortunately, not far past Fairview High, the gears completely stopped working (pedaling forward was just like pedaling backward). So, I had to scooter-push the darn thing to the Southside Walnut Cafe, then take the bus in. In any case, I'm going to take it easy this afternoon. I won't make the same mistake as yesterday of sitting in my chair for eight hours, but I'm not going to push it much either. Hopefully, things will be better tomorrow. Sorry, guys!
