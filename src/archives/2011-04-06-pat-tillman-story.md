Winds these past two months have been horrendous, in case you haven't noticed. I've noticed them mostly on my commutes.

Good week thus far for me: rode Flag on Monday; Northwest Passage yesterday. Hope to keep it up today with Sunshine?

Time to schedule another road cleanup. Who's game?

By the way, Greg's birthday is Friday!!
