Dave's last great act of defiance. "No more PowerPoint presentations!"

Although Dave has told folks he's "gone fishing" with Zack this weekend, there's more going on behind-the-scenes.

To wit, his invectives against PowerPoint are legendary for both their vigor and length. But it seems as though he and an Army colonel went [one filibuster too far](http://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_upshot/20100827/tc_yblog_upshot/army-colonel-in-afghanistan-fired-for-criticizing-powerpoint) this time.

Have a great weekend!
