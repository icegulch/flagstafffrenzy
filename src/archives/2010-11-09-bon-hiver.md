We might get lucky and see some snow leopards today

After a really grand day yesterday, the weather will be more seasonal today with a good chance for flurries. Will we get "measurable" snow, though?

I'm guessing yesterday was the last day wearing shorts, but this fall has been wacky, so who knows. I think Dave could've snuck in a dip in Boulder Creek. I'm just sayin.

Noah just returned from a [fun event](http://aneventapart.com/2010/sandiego/) in San Diego. And he ever brought back gifts! Behold, [Damn You Auto Correct](http://damnyouautocorrect.com/)!

Anyone else anxious for the opening of _Harry Potter 7.1_? I'm dusting off my cape and wand tonight.
