I know the above video left me a little misty-eyed, so I apologize for the uncharacteristically somber video. Still, it left me hopeful. Hope you'll find it equally uplifting.

No photos from Adriana yet, but I'm guessing I'll have some to share tomorrow. In the meantime, you can [check out the Steamboat webcam](http://www.skihaussteamboat.com/netcam.jpg) to see all the snow!

Glad Dave and I got out today, despite the discouraging weather and odd start time. We now realize just how beholden we are to our biorhythms!
