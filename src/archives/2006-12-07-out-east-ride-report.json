      "body": "I'm going to make a copy of the note from Dave's doctor, white-out his name, and write mine in today. My case of wussitis is a side-effect of my very first sports injury! I'm going to use my Turf Toeâ„¢ as an excuse to head over to the Rec Center and lift weights instead of riding today. My magic eight-ball says &quot;Signs Point to Yes&quot; for good weather and a great ride tomorrow."
