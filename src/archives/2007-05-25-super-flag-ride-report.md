It was so nice out today I thought to myself, "why stop at just the Flagstaff summit?" I couldn't come up with a good answer (no 1 PM meeting today), so I kept going, past the Lost Gulch overlook, up to the park boundary. It was a great ride and there were a bunch of other people out enjoying the weather. It was 70 degrees and sunny, or as Steve might say, "too hot."
