Apparently, the lack of diversity in our rides of late has dissuaded all but the biggest Frenzy nerds. But today, with Poorman Loop thrown in the mix and temperatures tickling 60Â°F, some of the cool kids came out of the woodwork.

Yes indeed, K-No showed up in shorts, ready to ride. Like clockwork, the winds picked up and batted us around with one-two combinations as we pedaled up Boulder Canyon.

As soon as we reached Fourmile, however, the blustery conditions vanished. After that, there were no more obstacles, save a runnel of black ice that ambushed us to no avail on Poorman Road.

Descending Sunshine Canyon was as pleasant as a summertime ride in the Indian Peaks. Even Dave's brakes cooperated allowing him to alight safely on Mapleton Road. Great taste of spring!
