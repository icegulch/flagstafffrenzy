Couldn't find my copy of _Catcher in the Rye_ at home, but it appears to be available at Norlin.

Speaking of J.D. Salinger, I almost forgot one of [my favorite book openings](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/01/26/favorite-openings) by another New Hampshire writer:

> I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice—not because of his voice, or because he was the smallest person I ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my mother's death, but because he is the reason I believe in God...
> 
> John Irving – _A Prayer for Owen Meany_

Yay, [Adriana passed](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/01/29/yo-adriana#comment-2434) her Masters comps!! Congrats. It's time for some New Belgium beer.

Dave and I hit flag today, and I'd have to say conditions were borderline. The Dave Dicey-ness Scale (last calibrated in 1998 over at NIST) was pegged in the red.

Still, we made it home safely, and in truth, most of the road was bone-dry. It's just that the shady spots were still pure ice.

iSean's _Colorado Daily_ photo reminded Dave of something he couldn't articulate...until now. Behold iDog!!

Let the alterations to this photo continue!

Noah's now thrown his hat in the ring

Thanks, Noah!
