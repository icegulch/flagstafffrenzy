Dr. G gettin' jiggy on Widowmaker.

Greg and I couldn't make SB's early launch time, took off at noon instead. We ended up doing a clockwise Poorman.

I'm thinking the standard track gears on my Clark Kent may be a bad choice for that last little whoop-de-do at the top. By the time I caught Greg in the alpenburbs, darkness was falling we almost missed curfew getting home.
