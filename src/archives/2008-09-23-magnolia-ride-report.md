I've been finding myself pining for cooler temps, like those found back home

With Dave out due to an MRI that looks like the Isthmus of Ipswich, I had to fly solo today. What better way to celebrate the freedom of the road than with a little cruise up [Magnolia Road](http://tinyurl.com/4l8ma8)?

Ouch! That hurt. Some of the driveways up there are quite literally on the brink! I found myself constantly on the brink too...on the brink of a bonk, that is.
