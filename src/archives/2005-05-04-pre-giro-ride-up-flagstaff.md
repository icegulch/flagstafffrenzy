If you're all pumped for the Giro and are already having dreams of leading Cunego, Basso, and Simoni up the [Colle delle Finestre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colle_delle_Finestre) and Passo dello Stelvio, then join us for a Friday Flagstaff ride.

Apart from our very own hometown celebrity, Dave Underwood, we might see some hard core cyclists getting ready for the Boulder Stage Race or even other celebrities.

Indeed, Dave and I bumped into a famous author today!

We'll meet at Telecom at 12:10p. See you there!
