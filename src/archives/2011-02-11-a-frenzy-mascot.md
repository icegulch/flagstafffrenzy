title: A Frenzy Mascot?

If we had a mascot, this would be it! Or perhaps [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK0Njz6Ma3Q&hd=1).

Adriana and I spent an hour or so watching FailBlog videos last night. I'm such a romantic. Marital bliss is what you make it, my Frenz.

Anyhow, I'm anxious to revisit our favorite trail this afternoon, and I hope you can join. I ran Flag/Gregory yesterday, and the snow has rendered the rocks smooth and soft. Great running conditions!

If we don't see you, have a great weekend!
