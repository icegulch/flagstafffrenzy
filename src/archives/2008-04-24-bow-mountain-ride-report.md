Dave got stuck in the office today, so Rob and I had a decision to make: to ride Bow Mountain or something else. Since Rob had never been, we opted to go for it.

On top of braving the paved part of the ride, Rob actually rode the whole way up the dirt/gravel part to the "benches." First time! An impressive feat. Greg is no longer the only one who's ridden the whole thing continuously.

Anyhow, today is the day Mr. Burton returns. When we'll see him is anyone's guess at this point. I should contact my retired USAF Colonel uncle to see if we can get him a furlough or whatever they call it these days.
