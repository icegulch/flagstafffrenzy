The colors are getting there, but not quite...

Dave, Rob, and I took advantage of the lovely weather to spin up Flagstaff. It was warmer than yesterday, so the vest I toted up wasn't really necessary.

For the second time in as many weeks, I've found myself staring off at Inititation, wondering when the weather will be cool enough to seek out its zigzagging ramparts. Whoever said it would [snow by the end of September](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/pollsarchive#polls-2-ans), should be thankful we didn't place real bets.

Speaking of which, I just read the [Winter Park Weather Forecast](http://www.snowforecast.com/coloradofcst/winterpark.html) for next week, as I often do, and I liked what I saw:

> The overall pattern is still expected to become more fall-like in early October, with larger storms ginning up in the Gulf of Alaska, affecting the Northwest US first, then gradually moving into Colorado with possible snow. This weekend into the following week (3rd onward), our unsettled weather pattern may deliver a strong early-season low pressure system with possibly significant snow in all resort areas (but mainly northern resorts, along and north of the I-70, including Aspen, Vail, Winter Park).

Will it snow in early October here?
