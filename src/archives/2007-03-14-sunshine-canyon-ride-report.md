More from the film _Höllentour_ (Hell on Wheels)

Dave Fuller joined the Frenzy faithful today, even though most of the faithful were infidels! Only Matt had the courtesy of joining Mr. Fuller.

Dave U and I were AWOL and Greg went to the gym to do aquatic dance. Kevin was at Krispy Kreme.

I'll be out there tomorrow. Perhaps we can take a stab at Neva.

Feel free to let me know if you want a screening of _Höllentour_ (Hell on Wheels) sometime soon.
