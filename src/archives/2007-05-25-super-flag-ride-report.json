      "body": "Wow! What a great day! There are big patches of Fireweed blooming on Poorman Hill. Everything is green, the creek is clearing up and the kayakers are on it like ticks on a dog. Sunbathers in Eban Fine Park and about a million weekend warriors out training for the Bolder Boulder. I love this town. Speaking of 10 K's, let's wish our very own lovely and talented Sir Brian Kent the best of luck tomorrow on _his_ little ol' 10 K run... 10,000 ft. of elevation gain in under 6 hrs. Just a walk in the park for The Man."
