The streets on The Hill are packed slush-ice

All in all, great ride today. It's sunny, temps aren't too cold, no wind, and no one to share the road with.

But, despite the [seemingly dry conditions on campus](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/SlushIceOnFlagstaff#5395853087606646066), the roads on The Hill are in terrible shape, save 13th and 9th. I'm really glad I took the truck.

While the traffic was light, I was nearly swiped by a snowplow and boxed out by a big SUVâ€”one of those "I know how to drive in the mountains....FAST!" type dingbats. No other bikers at all, however!

I'll say it again: when your work allows you to spend the lunch hour looking at ponderosa pines smothered in felty snow, you just can't complain!
