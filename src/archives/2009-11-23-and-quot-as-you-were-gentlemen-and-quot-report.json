I have some excellent new winter gloves after finally putting my 10 year old Assos gloves to rest (I have gone to the dark side on all my gear Castelli poster boy now!). But failed to take my beanie as I rarely ever seem to put it on, it was a mistake. All that said it was a beautiful day for a ride!"

New gloves will be a must too, if I'm to continue riding the road bike.\n\nWhen I take &quot;the truck&quot;, I can always wear mittens, which are much, much warmer. I can also leave the crate on and throw all kinds of warm clothes in the back, Stay-Puft-Marshmallow-Man-style."
