Rob and I had a quick ride today. Still, the important thing is that we got out and enjoyed the fresh air. It was chilly coming down, as the shadowy, snow-covered areas still possessed some of their nip.

I'm still savoring the closed Amphitheater Road. It's so nice not to see cars and occasionally startle the woman who walks her two little terriers along the road.
