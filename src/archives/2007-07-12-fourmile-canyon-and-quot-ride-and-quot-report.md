Had to be inventive fixing a flat today

I made it up Fourmile Canyon today, but not down.

My front tire flatted on the way up, so I gingerly descended, re-filling the tires with air along the way. My (new) spare tube was already torn before I put it on, so I tried going with the old tube, which gave out at Boulder Canyon/Fourmile Canyon.

It was a long walk back.

I'm gone tomorrow, so Matt is on deck.
