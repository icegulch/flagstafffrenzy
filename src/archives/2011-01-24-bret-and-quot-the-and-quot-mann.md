Well, the Superbowl teams are set. Now to endure all the hype. One good way is to soak in a hot tub in Sarasotaâ€”a formula Adriana and I have followed for years.

Speaking of the newly _full-time_ researcher, she's headed up to Steamboat for the next few days to set up an experiment at the [Storm Peak Laboratory](http://stormpeak.dri.edu/). Yep, she gets to ski down for free! She calls it "the cost of doing business."

Hopefully it'll be less windy than yesterday up there. We tried to snowshoe near Caribou mine and didn't even leave the car because of the howling winds.
