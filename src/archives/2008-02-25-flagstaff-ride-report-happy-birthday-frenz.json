      "body": "I think I saw Steve Fossett yesterday. He was just above Heartbreak Hill. Steve saw him also. Middle-aged guy in a scorched jumpsuit running along the edge of the road, very confused looking. I felt like pulling over to tell him that his loved ones (and investors) were looking for him, but I was _this_ close to setting a post-55 PR, and I didn't want to lose my cadence. If _you_ see him, have him phone home."
