      "body": "The Jonesenator and I ended up doing lower 4-Mile. We took the creek trail up Boulder Canyon, then jumped into 4-Mile. She loved it. I'm going to see if I can waiver her out of gym class and into the Frenzy... Canyon cruising beats 8-count burpees and dodge ball any day in my humble opinion. With Burton going over the fence (in the wrong direction, if you can believe!) soon, I'll be looking for new sparring partners. Beautiful day, wasn't it?"
