Watch ITS's own Brian Hutchison compete in CrossVegas with yarn for a chain

That's right, folks. Brian Hutchison has formed a new team and is really tearing it up. Indeed, he's off to Seattle to compete in this weekend's [Single-Speed CycloCross World Championships](http://www.sscxwc.org)! Brian's hoping for snow and misery, for it will make the competition "epic."

Good luck, Brian!

In other news, Werner (aka, Papa Bear) has been getting advice from other rags (instead of the Frenzy's well paid "Dave"). He suggests we all take time to [assess whether or not our bosses are micromanagers](http://chronicle.com/article/My-Boss-Is-a-Micromanager/124986/).

I hear Dave's manager is.
