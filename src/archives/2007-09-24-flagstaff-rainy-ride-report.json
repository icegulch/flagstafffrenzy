      "body": "I figured I'd let SB draw the lightning off toward Flag whilst I snuck up 4 Pines to the Mesa Trail. Nothing like 20 billion volts to curl your hair. But, as Steve reported, no lightning, and the rain died down to a trickle. Almost had to call AAA for a tow up the ridge, though; that is the greasiest trail in the county when it's wet. If I squint, I can see the skid marks from my office window. Seriously. Here's to Fall and the promise of more mud and waist-deep snow!"
