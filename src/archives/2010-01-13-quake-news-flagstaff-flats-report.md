Greg was kind enough to keep me company on today's ride up Flagstaff. Fortunately for him, my company only lasted until just before the first turnout.

That's right: flat tire! I told Greg to go ahead while I changed the tire (I don't like to bring down everyone else's ride). And I managed to make a fairly quick change.

Continued up, saw Greg on his way down, wished him well, rode up to the steep hairpin, where I looked at my watch and saw I had been out for 45 minutes. Turnaround time.

I was actually thinking how lucky I was getting a flat on a day like today: nearly 60F, no precip, no wind.

Then, as I was descending near the lowest hairpin, I heard that dreaded fizzling noise again. Flat numero dos!

Out of spare tubes, I had a choice: walk or ride the bike and risk ruining my rim. I chose both.

I walk-rode the bike down to _Full Cycle_, thinking I could pick up a new tire and have them check the rim. But, alas, they were closedâ€”or at least their door was locked at 1:30p on a Wednesday.

All in all, I still think I'm lucky that this happened on a warm, sunny day.

Sounds like the earthquake near Port-au-Prince did not affect the Virgin Islands, so the Underwoods are hopefully okay. I really feel for the folks in Haiti, though.

Best wishes go out to Julian as well. Apparently he had a rather unfortuante rendezvous with black ice yesterday and has a raspberry or two today. Hope you're doing better, Julian!
