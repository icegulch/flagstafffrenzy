      "body": "As Steve and I waited for the runners just above Heartbreak Hill, I fished around in my jersey pocket and found an old dog-eared copy of Finigan's Wake that I'd been meaning to read. I was just past page 456 when Steve said he heard the runners coming up the trail... but it was just the Nature Appreciation Group from Golden West Nursing Home. They said they had passed the runners back down around the Bouldering Rocks, and they would probably crest the hill sometime after the war in Iraq was over. We really wanted to wait around for the guys, but I had to get back to town in order to catch my great grandson's college graduation. So we headed back down... Wonder if they're at the top yet."
