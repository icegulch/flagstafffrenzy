I'm sure we've seen Rodney Stanger on the side of Flagstaff Road!

Unreal. Is it November?

Wonderful weather this afternoonâ€”even the sandpits lining the hairpins weren't so bad. After a chilly commute to work, I showed up overdressed for sure.

Anyhow, Dave, Greg, and I noodled up at an amicable pace, and despite the efforts of unfriendly fellow cyclists bent on souring everyone's mood, our spirits lifted at every turn.

In unrelated news, I just found out, after buying more storage from them, that [Google has upped their limits](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/more-extra-storage-for-less.html); in fact, they did so the day after I bought more space for my personal Picasa account.

Not to worry, however, as they honored the new limits on existing accounts. So, instead of getting 10GB for $20/year, I'm getting 80GB (+1GB included with the free account). Heck, I could upload all my raw files and still not tickle 3% of my capacity.

Steve's got mad Google storage

They haven't upped free account storage either (still 1GB), so it's not like I'm wasting those $20. I wonder what this portends, however, as there's talk of a forthcoming service called [GDrive](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-docs-slowly-morphing-into-google.html).
