This represents the ultimate middle finger to old-school trogs like Bailey and me who simply haven't the suds to push 52/10's up Super Flag. I'm not quite sure what his new ride will like, but the Seanster tells me it helps to picture a paper clip on wheels. Something at once brutally minimal _and_ wholly dysfunctional. Sounds a lot like my cousin Ernie. DU"
