I'm glad the Frenz weren't on this show...

Kevin, Matt, and I enjoyed a mild (70s) day today, as opposed to the hot, hot day we had yesterday.

Though we opted for a conversational pace, we had a hard time hearing one another because of the blustery southeast breeze. Oh well...could've been worse.
