Man, _The Electric Company_ was a weird show...and for kids no less!

Today marked the first ever fully hydro ride, meaning it was raining during the entire outing. It wasn't fun, no matter what Dave tells you.

To quote myself during the descent:

> It's been a long time, but I reckon this is what a wet diaper feels like.

Despite having a dry wool shirt to change into at the top, arm-warmers, and a rain jacket, I still felt soggy and miserable all the way down; indeed, my fingers are still red and it's hard to type.

Dave was super-chipper through-and-through. His attire: orange vest-shirt and cycling shorts.

That guy is nuts. I'm glad he talked me into it, though.
