Adriana and I took advantage of the continued mild fall weather today, pointing our skinny tires toward the tippy-top of Flagstaff. Despite the occasional convoy of wanna-be race car drivers, we enjoyed a relatively quiet day in the saddle.

There wasn't much dancing on the pedals this afternoon, though. The winds were at your back at one moment, down your throat the next. Still, when you're climbing in a short-sleeve jersey in November, you really can't complain.

One thing Dave's noted in recent comments is the return of the dreaded sandpits, particularly in the hairpin corners. Be careful when you're descending, folks.
