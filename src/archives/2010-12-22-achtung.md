I'm a big fan of the art of misdirection

Just because it's now winter doesn't mean we have to stop doing dumb things. Yesterday, Greg reminded me of this oft' overlooked Frenzy Commandment.

As a result, HQ decided to send us on a scouting mission on January 3rd. Behold! The [Fragnolia loop](http://bit.ly/fIk1yd). We'll see what the weather has to say about it.

Speaking of harebrained adventures, Noah suggests we cast our eyes over to Vimeo to watch a helmet-less, brakeless, gearless, and under-dressed Frenchmen [climb the Simplon Pass](http://vimeo.com/17758957) in the Alps.
