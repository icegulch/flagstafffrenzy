      "body": "BTW, the Cheney comment got me thinking... Remember when the Dickster bagged his first attorney (Sadly, it was during quail season, so it got no mention in the [Boone and Crockett](http://www.boone-crockett.org/) record books. The sucker was _huge_.) and there was loose talk about alcohol consumption and a long wait before calling the authorities? If you recall, the vice-prez said something about &quot;maybe having a beer _under an old oak tree._&quot; _Under an old oak tree!_ Say what you will about the VP's hygiene, the dude is one smart cookie. Because apparently, when you rig the _under an old oak tree_ suffix to a statement, you can get away with _anything_. We invaded the wrong country _under an old oak tree._ Mom and Dad, I think I just sniffed glue _under an old oak tree._. Little Darryl dressed up like a nun and dismembered his math teacher _under an old oak tree_. Bless his heart. I'm just thankful there aren't any old oak trees on Flagstaff."
