      "body": "Well that was fun. An old friend and I knocked out Lee Hill/Left Hand/Olde Stage today. It was way too hot for such nonsense. We were both three-quarters fried by the time we topped out of Lee Hill and threatening to self-mutiny, i.e., simply roll back down the mountain and blow off the rest of the route. (Truth be told, I was flirtin' with the vapors most of the way up due to the heat. Yuck.) But a little cloud cover and a very quick romp down Left Hand evened things out. Olde Stage was surprisingly easy and the run down 36 to Jay was positively exhilarating. Very nice ride. DU"
