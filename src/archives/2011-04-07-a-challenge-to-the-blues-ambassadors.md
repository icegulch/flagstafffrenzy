You may have already seen this on the internets, but still way cool! (courtesy of Justin)

So, I ended up going to lunch with Gammon and A-Mac yesterday, avoiding the light drizzle and soggy roads. I'm getting soft.

Today is another day, tho. Since we'll soon be doing a road cleanup, let's take a look at the trash alongside Sunshine Canyon Drive. Hopefully no BMWs this time.

Tomorrow is Greg's birthday!!!
