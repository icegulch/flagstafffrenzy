Dave and I enjoyed a chilled but sun-soaked ride up Flagstaff this noonday.

We've gotten in the habit of going to the tippy top, which is a real pleasure now that the gate to the top is closed to cars. No more worrying about folks who fancy themselves a race-car driver (a non-sport, by the way).

> It looks as though the gang at [Flatirons Fever](http://flatironsfever.blogspot.com/) have organized activities too. We are The Frenz, so what do you suppose they'll call themselves? The Flatheads?
