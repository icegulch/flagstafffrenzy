      "body": "Three Frenzy faithfuls (Dave, Rob, and Matt) took to the streets only to thumb their noses at Steve's assigned &quot;homework&quot; ride and instead pointed their tires southeast toward Cherryvale Road citing something about wind. On the return to campus (via the Broadway bike path) Dave and Rob complained about the slow pace and constant interruptions. Mr. Underwood was (mis)quoted as saying, &quot;Dagnabit, that there youngin' Burton is stopping to canoodle with every 21-to-25-year-old lass seen within a half mile of this here trail.&quot; Mr. Burton was unavailable for comment."
