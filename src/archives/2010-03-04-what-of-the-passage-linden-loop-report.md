Kinda reminds me of Dave and me when gathering for a ride at HUMN

Greg joined the usual suspects on today's ride up Linden Loop. It was nice to have fresh blood, as Dave and I had started to bring our laptops along so we wouldn't have to talk to one another.

Thanks, Greg.

Tomorrow might be cooler, but that just means it'll be more fun. See you then!
