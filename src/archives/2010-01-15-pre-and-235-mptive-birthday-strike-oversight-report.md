The armies of Middle Earth are no match for Gammon's empire!

Tomorrow is Gammon's birthday, so wish him well if you see him today!

**Note to Self**: When promising to ride at lunch after having had a flat, always be sure that you have spare tubes to fix said flat.

Sorry, guys and gals. I had to bail because I have no spare tubes in my office with which to fix the Cannondale.

###### Free This Weekend?

Dave's band will be playing this coming Saturday night at _The Zone_ in Longmont.

Details for this show and more can be found on [the band's rockin' website](http://www.thebluesambassadors.com/).
