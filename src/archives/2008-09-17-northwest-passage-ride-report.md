Dave and I felt as though we were frogs on the road today!

Great minds don't think, as they say!

Indeed, today Dave and I followed our misguided hearts, which called us to the Northwest Passage. Like a Shackleton voyage, our journey was filled with hazards and objective dangers, but we survived with teamwork and determination.

Well, actually, it was just some basic bikehandling skills. Still, great to dust that ride off the shelves. Thanks, Davey!
