DU will once again take to the airways with his trusty pal "Otto Pilot"

Yes, that's not a typo! Dave was cleared to ride this afternoon by his doctor (or that's what he told me...someone get Ronna on the horn!).

I have a 12:30p meeting, so I was thinking of heading out at 11:30p, meeting at HUMN. Hope you can join us for the sashay!

###### Linda's New Pal

Frenzy HQ would like to extend a warm welcome to Penny of Longmont

Congratulations to Linda, who adopted a new pooch recently. Penny is three years old and full of energy, like all of the Frenz.

###### Cheating News: Doping Comes to Bass Fishing

When they start [cheating at bass fishing](http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/blog/19468/cheating%20scandal%20at%20us%20open%20rocks%20bass-fishing%20community/), it's not just the judges who get mad

MarkW sent this sad story along, in view of all the recent doping news. I suppose money is a real corrupting force in this world. Dave, has Zack ever stuffed a lure into a trout to impress Frenz?

###### Tour of Colorado!

Personally, I think the "Red Zinger Classic" had a better ring to it, but I'll settle for Quiznos Pro Challenge!

Many of you already heard the news, but Julian wanted us to know that the non-annual _Tour de Frenz_ will now have competition from the annual (late August) [Quiznos Pro Challenge](http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/lance-armstrong-announces-the-quiznos-pro-challenge). Can't wait to hear what the stages will be!
