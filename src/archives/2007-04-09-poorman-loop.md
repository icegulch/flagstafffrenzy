Greg wasn't too happy with all the mud along Poorman Road, but he's a sport!

In honor of Matt's toe, we rode Matt's favorite route: [Poorman Loop](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/fourmile_poorman_sunshine.gif).

Joining us from New Hampshire was another former Princeton rider, Katie. We hoped the altitude would slow her down more, but no such luck: she was strong! Thanks to Dave, Greg, and Adriana for riding too.

Tomorrow we'll tackle Super-Flag, showing our visitor a real good time.
