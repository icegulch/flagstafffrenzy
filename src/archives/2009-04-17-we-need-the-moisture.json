Oh, and by the way Bailey, I've found Pringles in remote villages in Ireland. Fairly certain you could pop the top of some from your vacation spot. Where are you anyway?"

      "body": "We think it was Pano Point on Flag, but with the snow falling like it was - flakes the size of sparrows coming down so hard they made a whooshing sound as they swirled past - it was hard to tell. There were rocks and trees and big stone steps, so we were pretty certain it wasn't the Pearl Street Mall. We were also certain it didn't really matter... what a great storm to be out in. But poor Kimberly; she had to go straight to a meeting w/out a change of clothes. Between the nascent hypothermia and the near-lethal levels of procedural droning, she almost succumbed. Way to hang in, Berly! Ahh.. springtime in the Rockies... the only thing I know of that's moodier is my mother-in-law, drinking Diet Snapple and reminiscing about the Dark Ages. DU"
