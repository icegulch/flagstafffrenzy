I believe iSean has his eyes on one of these

It was great to see a new face on today's ride: Mark Knowles, Director of ALTEC. He muscled up the steep ramparts of the climb, then enjoyed the flatter middle and top sections. Bravo, Mark!

Rob joined us for the festivities, informing us that Sir Brian Kent appears to have forgotten his sunscreen on some kind of crazy desert 50 miler recently. In New England, we'd start calling him "lobstah."

Dave had to go home and sign for a FedEx package. I think that's code for "take a long nap" though.

Great conditions for the climb, by the way! Despite the sweltering temps (70s), the snowbanks alongside the road kept things comfortable.
