Dave's _nom de plume_ is "Debra Jackson"

It was sprinkling when I stepped out the door at noon, and things didn't look like they were going to get much better. So, I decided to stay close to home and spin up Flag.

Near the top, I was reminded of Mount Washington in summer: fog, cool temps, and humid. Indeed, I ended up having to take off my sunglasses because they kept fogging over. I was psyched that I recently threw one of those cloth wipes for glasses in my under-the-seat pouch.

Brought (and used) a rain jacket and arm-warmers today. Only 59Â°F at the Mesa Lab currently.
