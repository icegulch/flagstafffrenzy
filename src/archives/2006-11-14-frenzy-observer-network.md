A Frenzy observer at an undisclosed outpost

**Let's meet at Humanities at 12:20p. Bring your bike and a lock, for I'm leaning toward some type of duathlon.**

I wore my running shoes today. I view this less as a lack of faith in our ability to ride into the teeth of 40mph winds and more as the expression of a desire to wear bright orange shoes. You, O'Gentle Readers, will understand, I'm sure.

In any event, today more than ever, the Frenzy needs your help. If you have a window in your office, please post your weather observations as comments before the noon hour. Your readings will help decide our fate today! Bon courage!
