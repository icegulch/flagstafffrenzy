Good design isn't always about effete notions of taste, which is just fine with me

I'm stuck inside today, but Dave's heading up Flag and looking for company. If you're game, give him a ring at 2-2672. He's up for something half an hour either side of noon.

Ferocious winds on the ride in this morning. The ride must have been in the top three worst I've had on the commute in. I think you could ride to Kansas today sans-pedaling.
