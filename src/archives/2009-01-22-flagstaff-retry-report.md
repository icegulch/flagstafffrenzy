Hiking to Gray Knob Cabin in New Hampshire's Presidential Range

Great company and ride up the hill today. We even saw Brian Hutchison, who followed up Flagstaff with a short sprint up Poorman. Yikes! Shorts and short-sleeves. Unreal!

  
For my dad's Christmas gift, I digitized some of his old 16mm films

My dad shot these scenes circa 1958-9 in Stark and West Milan, NH. Can you spot the black bear?

The unique sleds were the invention of my great uncle Henry, whom you see at the ice falls in a red wool jacket in a place called Devil's Hopyard. Uncle Henry had a crosscut saw world record (1935) and was renown in the north country for [grafting apple tree branches](http://www.greatnorthwoods.org/milan/orchard/) (225 different species on one tree).

I think these digitized clips are fantastic. I had them done professionally in Atlanta at an outfit recommended by Wired Magazine; they're called [Cin√©Post](http://www.posthouse.com/). They use a "wetgate" process to remove scratches and a scene-to-scene color-correction process. Results speak for themselves!
