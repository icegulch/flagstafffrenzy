You pick it up, really start motoring, and when you come to a nice steep little switchback, you scoot back in the saddle a bit, and hit it as hard as you can, with no warning.(The trick, of course, is to appear ultra-casual when you attack: shoulders loose, elbows bent, upper body relaxed.) You're sure you've dropped the guy - let's call him Steve now - and you motor like hell up through the next turn. That's when you dare to take one of those furtive little peeks back over your shoulder to see how badly you've dusted him... and he's RIGHT THERE!!! SMILING!! Then what? He pulls on through and leaves you in the weeds, that's what. Actually it's all part of why we love cycling, isn't it? Great ride guys!"
