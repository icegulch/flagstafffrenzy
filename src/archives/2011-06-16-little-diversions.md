A little downhill bike race I entered yesterday

As you all know, I have legendary bike-handling skills, especially when it comes to technical, downhill mountain biking. I'm also world-renowned for my modesty.

In any event, I was in Chile yesterday and decided to put my rental bike through its paces. Apart from the shepherd that ran under my tire, all went well. That's why I missed yesterday's spin. Sorry.

Today, we should have more luck getting out. Perhaps you'll find out where I'm hanging my hat during the days now. But, venture a guess in today's poll before you ask.
