      "body": "Two Men and a Brain It's true; Bailey and I have been brain-pooling for something like two years now. Not only do we feel like we're saving energy and making the world a better place for future generations, but we've also come to appreciate just how wasteful and inefficient our old one guy/one brain system had become. It used to be that if I, for instance, wanted to take a quick fantasy spin down to, say, the pool bar at Jimmy D's in Miami, I'd just do it, neurons be damned. But now that I have to check in w/ Steve first, I'm a lot more judicious. &quot;Steve, I want to use the brain for a few... any problem with that?&quot; &quot;No, I'm in a meeting. I don't need it.&quot; &quot;I'll have it back by three.&quot; &quot;Keep it overnight if you want. Sean's coming over for dinner and I sure as hell won't be needing it for that.&quot; &quot;Okey dokey, then. And this time I promise I won't leave it a mess for you.&quot; &quot;Heard that before.&quot; This time-share agreement has worked out so well, in fact, that we're considering adding a third partner. I really only use it for daydreaming and opening beers, and SB is pretty much down to weekending. Interested? Give us a call. DU"
