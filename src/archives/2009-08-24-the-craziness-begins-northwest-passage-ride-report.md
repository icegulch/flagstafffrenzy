Dave and Rob braved the frenzied waters leaving campus with me today. Wow, what a difference a day makes!

Once on 4th, however, it was easy riding. Atop Linden, Dave and Rob had time to continue down Northwest Passage, while I did a couple of laps on the Linden Lariat, as I call it.

How was it, guys? Thanks for joining!
