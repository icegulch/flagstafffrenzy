The Frenz aren't the only ones who know how to handle a lasso  
**Little Known Frenzy Fact**: Dave was cast as "The Falcon" before being replaced by Mike Brady

So, I headed out solo on today's intended ride when around Baseline I espied smoke emanating from the vicinity of my house. Needless to say, my ride plans changed there on the spot.

As it turns out, there's a [controlled burn](http://www.dailycamera.com/news/ci_13347135) in the Boulder Mountain Parks today up on Shanahan Ridge (looks like it's above the junction of the Mesa and Big Bluestem trailsâ€”you can kinda see it in the middle left of [this webcam](http://boulderflatironcam.com/)).

Still, for about 13 minutes, I wondered if I'd have time to pull my dogs out of the smoke. The ride there was no warm-up lolly-gag for sure.

All is well, though. Lesson learned: we need to make sure the spare key to the house is put back in its hiding place; otherwise, I'm going to have to go Kanye on my sliding door.

  
And now for a real television show...

Can't wait for the start of Season 4!
