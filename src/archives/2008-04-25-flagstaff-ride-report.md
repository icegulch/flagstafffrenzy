In honor of the returning Mr. Burton...Strong Bad

Someone put an APB out for Mr. Underwood. Haven't seen him since our tour in 'nam.

Rob wasn't MIA today. He and I braved blustery conditions (even for Flagstaff) to finish the week off in style. Fortunately, the temperatures were just perfect for endurance activities.

Mr. Leary was doubly-daring this afternoon, dual-thon'ing the workout by biking to Gregory Canyon then running the rest of the way. Do we have a GEarth screenshot of the trail? Perhaps we soon will.

Have a wunderbar weekend, all!
