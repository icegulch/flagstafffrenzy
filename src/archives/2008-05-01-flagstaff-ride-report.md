Amazing that it was so warm yesterday, and yet today is so cold!

We lucked out today: perhaps due to the snow, the Amphitheater Road was not yet open. Even more impressive, we didn't see another cyclist on the entire outing. Only three or so cars too.

Surprising if you ask me, as it really wasn't tremendously cold or even wet. And the conditions were just magical. Thanks to my usual cohort for joining!

I'm not ready for hot weather!!!
