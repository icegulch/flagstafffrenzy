title: Fourmile Sunshine Canyon Ride Report

I did Fourmile last week, so I decided to make a last minute change and head for Sunshine. It's noticeably cooler, but it seems more humid. I sweat a lot, anyhow. Probably better than 4% humidity from a health standpoint, though.

So, can anyone picture Favre playing for the Vikings? How much motivation will he have playing GB twice a season?!
