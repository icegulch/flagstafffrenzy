Glad he's contented himself w/ eggs; they'll give the old shack a healthy sheen (tho' I doubt the prissy neighbors will countenance the smell.) Celestial Seasonings is a pleasant enough enterprise to have in the 'hood. I was a horribly shocked, though, when I learned they were doling out their original &quot;Sleepy Time&quot; blend to the resident prairie dogs under cover of darkness. I'd like to see the lable art for _that_ little episode."
