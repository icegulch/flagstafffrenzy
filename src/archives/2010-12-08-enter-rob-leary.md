On our way home today (from London), Dave dropped some crazy bike tricks

Great to see Mr. Leary on today's ride. Glad he could get out for a bit of climbing. How far past Old Stage did you go, Rob? He sounds very happy, and the Toscano-Leary clan is quite content.

Mark wanted to pass along some workplace [holiday party advice](http://finance.yahoo.com/career-work/article/111487/how-not-to-behave-at-the-office-party?mod=career-worklife_balance). Perhaps he knows us too well?

Sorry for all the faux-Betasso ride announcements. I promise, we'll sneak it in before it's too sandy or icy.
