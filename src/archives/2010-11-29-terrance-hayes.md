Terrance was a star grad student at Pitt and used to play hoops with us

I was very happy, but not surprised, to hear that Terrance Hayes was [recently published in the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/poetry/2010/11/29/101129po_poem_hayes). This just adds to an already impressive résumé (or "cv" in academe-speak), including a National Book Award, a Pushcart Prize, and more.

I never thought it was fair of my grad school buddies to make me guard Terrance during our basketball practices—he's about 6'5". Most of his poems made me laugh, especially when he'd start laughing half-way through.

Terrance is now a professor at Carnegie Mellon (our very own Werner's alma mater). Now Adriana and I have one more reason to go visit!
