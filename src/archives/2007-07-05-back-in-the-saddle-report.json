      "body": "Frenz, I have a bit of bad news. While waiting for Kevin on the north side of the Humanities Building I had a little... incident. I was warming up on Pleasant Street in front of the Rec Center and somehow I managed to crash at slow speed. I didn't clip out in time and hit the pavement on my left side. Fortunately I was going quite slow and the only result was a good bit of road rash on my left knee, arm, and shoulder. My bike took a some damage to the handlebars as well as the normal nicks and scratches. Needless to say I will be out for the balance of this week and at least a portion of next week while I heal and get my bike fixed. One of these days I'm going to learn how to use these clip-in pedals properly."
