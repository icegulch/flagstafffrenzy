###### Happy Birthday, Burton!

Tomorrow is our old pal Matt's birthday. Please wish him well either with a personal email or with a nasty comment here.

###### Bon Voyage (and Happy Early B-Day) to Sean

Safe travels to iSean, who leaves for Australia on Sunday for a long trip and bike tour. We look forward to a photo journal upon your return, Sean! Also, happy pre-emptive birthday (Nov 29)! You're 21 now, aren't you?
