Dave's new Flagstaff pal, Jean-Yves Blondeau

The cloak of fog seemed to encourage the criminal element on Flag today... Saw a guy wedeling down the road on a skateboard wearing a full-coverage motorcycle helmet and a smoking sole.

And a bunch of high school kids hotboxing in a BMW just below the Boatramp. They must've cracked the windows a hair to lean up the mixture, because I could smell the reefer from two switchbacks down. Their little secret.

Great ride; cold, foggy, and wet. Bailey weather. -DU
