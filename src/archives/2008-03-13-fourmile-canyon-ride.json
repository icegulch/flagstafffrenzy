We're outta' here. I remember the photographer from the Daily telling me she was interested in shooting &quot;art pictures&quot; for their special &quot;Evolution: A Cosmic Trainwreck?&quot; issue, but I honestly believed she was just dialing in her light meter until a _real_ curiosity came along. Never expected to see myself in roaring black and white on page three! Record number of cancelled subscriptions the next day, if I recall. Sheesh."
