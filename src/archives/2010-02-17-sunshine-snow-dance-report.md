There's snow in the forecast. We might need added traction! (courtesy of Linda)

I'm confident our snow dance will produce results! Dave and I saddled up and biked over to Poorman Junction this afternoon as part of the festivities.

Given my recent cold, I'm able to be at 100% phlegm production levels while only at 60% effort. Dave's keeps the street cleaning truck between him and my "trail."

I might slap on the YakTrax tomorrow for some kind of duathlon. Dave says he'll be astride his trusty Clark-Kent, so a duel is in the offing.
