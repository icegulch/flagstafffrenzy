Once again, Dave and I explored new frontiers of pain, combining Northwest Passage and Linden Loop into a route we're christening _Criminal Mischief_.

Our designs will not end there, however, as we're hoping to combine this route with one more "green monster" of our diurnal sojourns: Back Alley. When completed, that ride will be called _Criminal Intent_. Hope you can join us for that one!

###### Again, Freaky Frenzy Tomorrow!

Don't forget your costume tomorrow on the second annual [Freaky Frenzy](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/FirstFreakyFrenzy?feat=directlink), which will take place snow or shine!!! Of course, if it rains, let's go bowling...in costume, of course.
