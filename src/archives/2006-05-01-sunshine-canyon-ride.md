Looks like sun and warm temps today, so it's only fitting that we noodle up Sunshine Canyon.

This is a great route for mountain bikers, as the slope is quite steep, making for a spinny ride up and a nice slalom down. In fact, I think Terry's hit 45mph before on the descent.

Though I undoubtedly won't reach speeds approximating 35mph, I will enjoy the lovely weather and fun descent. Hope you can join me!
