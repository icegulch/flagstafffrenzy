The authorities caught wind of our plans and were ready for us

Greg and I successfully rode Back Alley today. While some might deem our ride back to campus in a paddywagon the sign of an unsuccessful ride, we beg to differ. Like Inspector Clouseau, police rides are par for the course with the Frenz.

It was nice to sneak a ride in before the impending storm. I'm quite sure we'll be on foot tomorrow, so bring your running shoes!

Until then, enjoy the snow and drive/ride safely.
