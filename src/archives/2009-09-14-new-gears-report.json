      "body": "It's nice to see some real talent up on the Frenzy bridge for a change. Way to go, Adriana! I'll have to beg off on Flag today. I took a spill on South Arapahoe Peak yesterday and my knee has gone south on me. I can barely walk this morning. (What's new?) I'm planning on spinning out east today, hoping a little light duty workout will loosen things up. The Baseline rez loop, in case any other disabled vets want to join me. Can't wait to see what iSean does with gears! DU"
