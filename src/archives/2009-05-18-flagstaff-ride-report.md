Great ride today! Apparently, iSean just missed us, but we picked up a third in the form of Tom Zeiler, who was decked out in Miguel Indurain gear!

That guy is hard-core. Hope we see him again! I saw Dr. Lenski in front of Humanities, and he's threatening to join us again soon. Wow, with the addition of 39:05 iSean and these profs, we've got some real firepower!
