Can you name this member of the Frenz? **Hint**: His birthday is this Friday!

It should've been called "Headwind Canyon" today. Better workout, though, I suppose. Poorman Road is in great shape, either for climbing or descending. Nice hard-packed dirt.

Bumped into one of the Frenzy lurkers, Lori Emerson, going down Fourmile. Lori is a new faculty member in English, who just recently purchased a Specialized Roubaix. She's promised to join us Friday for a ride up Flagstaff. Lurker no more, eh, Lori?

###### Sendoff for Dennis Tomorrow?

No official word from the man of honor on riding in high winds tomorrow, but I'm guessing we'll hold off. Dennis?
