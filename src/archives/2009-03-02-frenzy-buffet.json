      "body": "RE: load times after the RSS feed. I haven't noticed anything myself, but I don't routinely hold a timer up to websites. I figure that if it's faster than CULink, it's fast enough. Unless more people start to use it, then I could see it getting moved to another area, like the Bios page. I'll likely continue to use it, mostly because it's a good motivation to get out there and do something (even if it's not a technically a Frenz ride)"
