Steve, Rob, and I had a glorious, if somewhat blustery slog up Fourmile today. A conundrum, though; if you have a tail wind going up Boulder Canyon and a head wind going up Four Mile, where the hell does all that air go? If you think you know the answer, jot it down on a 4 X 5 inch postcard and send it, duct-taped to 1957 sunburst-gold Gibson Les Paul guitar with twin humbucker pickups and original hardshell tweed case, here to Frenzy HQ. Winner(s) will receive a free ride on SB's handlebars. DU
