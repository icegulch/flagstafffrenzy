Dave filed this report from his vacation home in Summit County office:

> Rob and I dodged sand traps, ice caps, and gas-guzzling Jeep saps today in an effort to replant the Frenzy Flag atop our fair mountain. Mission accomplished, though it was touch-and-go on the trip home. I hate Baseline when it's iced up and the jerk in the Ford Mastadon at your seven-o'clock insists on giving you one bike length for every two hundred miles-per-hour. Tightens things up, if you know what I mean.

Thanks, Dave and Rob! I'll try to make it out tomorrow before I leave for the airport.
