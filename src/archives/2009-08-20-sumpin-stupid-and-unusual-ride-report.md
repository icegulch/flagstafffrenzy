"Scat," a term which applies to virtually every one of our rides (from Dave)  
I love the French Candian accent!

Well, I must say, even by my own warped standards, this ride was harebrained. It's not even worthy of christening, as I have no intention of riding it again.

Thanks to Greg and Dave for humoring me at least. Special thanks to Greg for following me into the unknown with a smile too!

Despite today's hike-a-bike snafu ([full gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/SunshineLeeHillPassageExpedition)), we did espy another route that merits another foolhardy foray. Greg [knows what I'm talking about](http://tinyurl.com/silly-crazy-ride)!
