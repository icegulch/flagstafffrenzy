Now I know what that water bottle on Dave's bike is for

Well, after watching Sean shave his head for a good cause (photos?), I was running a little late, so Dave and I bailed on Sunshine once again.

Flag was fantastic, though. Dave rode all the way up Super, while I wimped out at the top of the Boat Ramp. Great to see campus fall away from view nonetheless.
