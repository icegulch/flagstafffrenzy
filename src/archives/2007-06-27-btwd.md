Hope everyone biked to work today. Make sure you go to http://www.drcog.org/btwd2007/ and sign up with the ITS team if you haven't already. I have another meeting-challenged day so I won't be riding at noon, but I believe Matt was pointing toward a ride today. So those that want the camaraderie of a small group might want to meet up with Matt at Humanities at noon. Comment amongst yourselves.
