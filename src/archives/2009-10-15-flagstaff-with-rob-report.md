This photo of iSean surfaced on The Internets yesterday; he's such an activist (from [FailBlog](http://failblog.org))

Wow, what a change a few days can make! From snow and fog to wispy cirrus clouds and warm blustery winds.

Rob, Dave, and I profited from these conditions on our leisurely stroll up Flagstaff this afternoon, watching the flighty dance of the leaves as we floated downhill.

> ###### Nothing Gold Can Stay
> 
> Nature's first green is gold,
> Her hardest hue to hold.
> Her early leaf's a flower;
> But only so an hour.
> Then leaf subsides to leaf.
> So Eden sank to grief,
> So dawn goes down to day.
> Nothing gold can stay.

> \-Robert Frost, 1923

See you tomorow!
