Since SB is running on about four hours sleep - that's for the last three days - I'm tossing in some white noise of my own. Flagstaff was primo yesterday and today. Plastered snow and thick fog yesterday, with a little snowpack on the wall. Today the road was pristine; the Boulder County Highway guys had cleared things beautifully and the sun had dried out the last of the moisture. The ride was about as pretty as it gets. Greg went his own way, headed for a Chautauqua duathlon. I'm sure he had a good outing... hard to go wrong with weather like this! DU
