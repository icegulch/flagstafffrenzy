Let it never be said that a guy who concentrates exclusively on running big miles on trails is a limp nancyboy on the bike. Okay, go ahead and say it... but it wouldn't be true; Sir Brian Kent jumped the pack (me - DU) en route to Lost Gulch like a bionic yak on diet pills today. Screw "surge" in Iraq. We'll keep it here on the Frenzy where it was invented. Great ride, Brian. Hope you thaw out before Leadville.
