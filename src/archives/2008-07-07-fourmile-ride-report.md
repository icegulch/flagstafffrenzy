It is reported that Mr. X "may have" joined the Frenz today. This report has not been confirmed. Sources close to Mr. X declined to comment, stating it would be a "gross affront to common sense" if Mr. X were to have ridden today.

And this reporter will not rat out his pals! Unless it involves Scooter Libby of course.
