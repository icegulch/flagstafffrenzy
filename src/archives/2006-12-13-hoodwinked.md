So, after posting the South Boulder ride, having second thoughts and canceling it, I stepped outside to catch the bus, then—perhaps it was the gentle persuasion of the breeze on my shoulders—I suddenly decided I would saddle up and ride home in spite of the wind. I just couldn't bring myself to wait for the bus, ride the bus, go home, catch the bus again, ride again, and walk back to my office.

I'm sorry if my mercurial mindset has ruined your day in any way. I promise to make it up to you tomorrow with a punishing ride.
