It was a sizzler today. Poor Rob forgot his water bottles at home, but we occasionally biked past some sprinklers to let him catch a few drops.

Mr. Burton was as fiesty as ever, mounting a formidable sprint on Baseline. Toe-schmoe, I say!

Well, this is my last official post for a month. I'm leaving you, O' Gentle Reader, with a table of who will be posting from here on out.

All complaints should be directed at them.

I may make a post or two from Vancouver, and I'll include pix from the road. Meantime, be safe and happy! Take care, fellas and gals!

**PS**: Sean Myers says he's going to ride with us...hold him to it!
