Yes, you've read the title correctly! We rode up Flagstaff today, though I had to turn around at Panorama Point to get back for meetings with faculty.

As you might have guessed, Fair-Weather Frenz were nowhere to be found, but the hard-core (aka, dumb) Frenz rode to glory. We even saw Bryan (paniers and all) heading up, so the road must be good!

Tomorrow, we'll hit it again, temperatures permitting.
