Ready for the coming storm? Sit by the fire with us during our winter overnight in NH's White Mountains

Professor Tom Zeiler did indeed join us today. Lucky for him, we know his habits and plucked him from his ATLAS stoop.

Instead of heading up high, we stuck to the lowlands, spinning around _Boxing Boulder_ at a steady clip.

Dave took off like a rocket on Baseline, only to overheat near the Cherryvale junction. He was forced to shed some layers. I was also overdressed, having my mind pre-occupied with the looming storm.

No matter, we had lots of laughs and even a few ideas along the way. Thanks, guys!
