Ouch! The doggie and rider were apparently okay...where was the dang owner?!

I'm hot just thinking about the ride up Flagstaff today. It was incredibly hot, and yet air quality is listed as good.

The air in my lungs didn't feel too good, though. I was really suffering, despite swilling the liquid contents of two water bottlesâ€”one contained water, the other an electrolyte drink.

If it were fall, I would've kept the same pace on a tricycle.
