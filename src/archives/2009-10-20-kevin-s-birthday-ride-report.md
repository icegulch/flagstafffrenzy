All your Frenz wish you a Happy Birthday, Kev!

Dave and I proved today that you can celebrate someone else's birthday in their absence and still have a blast.

Indeed, poor Kev was undoubtedly tied up in some IdM meeting while DU and I noodled up Flagstaff. Interesting weather too.

The temperature seemed to be dropping about a degree every 10 minutes and the clouds were rolling in, so much so that we could smell Greeley upon returning to The Hill.

We both felt good in the crisp conditions. Dave had an engaging discussion with his imaginary friend Perley, or "Twinkle Toes" as he calls him. Maybe he was just cold....
