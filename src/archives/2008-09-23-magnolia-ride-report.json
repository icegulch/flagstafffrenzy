      "body": "It was one of those dreams: the kind that flickered to life as soon as his head hit the pillow. It was vivid and bright and achingly familiar. Phyllis Schlafly had just hung out the &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign and was putting little umbrellas in the Mai Tais when the phone rang. It was Carruthers, the intern. &quot;Mr. President, I hate to disturb your nap, but I knew you would want to know...&quot; &quot;Know _what?!!_ It's not that sniveler Paulson whining about the banks again, I hope.&quot; &quot;No sir, it's...&quot; &quot;McCain? I've already promised him I'd lay low 'til the election. What's he after now, blood?&quot; &quot;No sir, it...&quot; &quot;Dick bag another scheister?&quot; &quot;No sir. This is much more important. _The gallery is back up on the Frenzy, sir._ It seems Steve Bail...&quot; &quot;Hot damn!&quot; cried the Decider as he snapped upright from the couch. &quot;This is great news, Carruthers! Get in here and turn my computer on for me, will you?&quot; &quot;Right away sir! Shall I bring you an Ovaltine to celebrate?&quot; &quot;Hell, yes! And cancel the reception for Gordon Brown tonight... I've got some catchin' up to do!&quot; DU"
