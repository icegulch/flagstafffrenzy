You needn't be Thoreau to enjoy the Maine Woods

Someday, Adriana and I intend on either hiking or skiing Maine's 100 Mile Wilderness. Kayaking the Allagash might be fun too. Who wants to join us?

A side trip to [Acadia National Park](http://www.nps.gov/acad/) would be in order, of course.

As you may have noticed, I've rebooted this hunk of junk. Wanted to create archives for _Dear Dave_ and modularize the graphic design, widening it in the process.

Indeed, the overarching goal was straightforward: provide more space for trash talk.

Still much to do, so I apologize in advance for the kinks. Feel free to let me know when you find 'em.
