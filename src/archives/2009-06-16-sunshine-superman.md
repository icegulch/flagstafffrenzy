Inmates, or "artisans in residence" as they prefer to be called, of NH's Concord State Prison, take great pride in producing the nation's finest hand-crafted license plates. The state motto, however, confuses them.

Well, it's Tuesday, which means Adriana and Steve are well into their second gallon of Deep Woods Offâ„¢. We wish them luck; New Hampshire's mosquitoes have come to regard the stuff as a decent, if somewhat cloying, antipasto.

How does a ride up Sunshine sound for today? Or...?
