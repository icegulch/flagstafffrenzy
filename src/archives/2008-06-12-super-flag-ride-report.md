Rob, Dave, and I had a super ride up Super-Flag this afternoon. One would think it was December, what with the shifty winds and all. Good thing was the wind sure kept your sweat from getting in your eyes or glassesâ€”it's so dry, your sweat flash-evaporates! Indeed, just checked and the relative humidity today is 12%.

Rob had an intriguing idea: a Super-Flag duel, where runners race bikers by taking Gregory Canyon and the Long Canyon trails. Sounds fun!
