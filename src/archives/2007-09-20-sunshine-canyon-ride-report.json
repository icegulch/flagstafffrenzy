      "body": "Well, for a first ride back from Mononucleosis, that was killer! Steve Bailey took the lead up this steep hill, with me and Matt in close pursuit. Zipping past Poorman Rd, we saw Matt Burton point the front wheel of his his trusty Fuji back down the hill, while Steve Bailey pushed on to the top. I soon followed intrepid Bailey to the crest--but not without watching him triumphantly turn around and head back down from the crest. It's good to be back."
