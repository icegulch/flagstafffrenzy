      "body": "A Discovery Channel addict, I remember watching what seemed very much an ad—not a Discovery Channel program—about this [Bering Strait Bridge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKoglNc9__o) and thinking to myself: Why? I honestly wonder who was behind the program (Discovery contracts with production companies). Likewise, I question the true motives behind the bridge, especially considering its greenwashed name [The Intercontinental Peace Bridge.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bering_Strait_bridge) Wouldn't oil barons like a pipeline to Kazakhstan, with its [stores of oil](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html#Econ) that rival those of the Middle East?! The Kazakhs just built a pipeline to China, after all. Reactionary, you say? Well, try [poking around the internets](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_38/b4100074992471.htm) a bit and get back to me. Or just watch minute 4:20-4:45 of the [Discovery video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKoglNc9__o). What's this have to do with cycling, you ask? What's the capital of Kazakhstan, I retort?!"
