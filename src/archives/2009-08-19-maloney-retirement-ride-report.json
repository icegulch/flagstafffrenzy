      "body": "Wow...called out by the Big Dog himself! Clearly I failed to allow Dennis to get a firm grip on my wheel before rolling up to Dave and Greg. I blame everything on Dave however - he gave me a 'look' that reminded me of the old days 10 or more years ago when we used to ride Flag together. So while reminiscing I got lost and took a wrong turn _cough_ it was a great ride by all. Dennis now that you are retired we will see much more of you on these rides right?"
