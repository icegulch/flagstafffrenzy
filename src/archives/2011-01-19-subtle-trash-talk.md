In other news, it appears the [feds are putting the squeeze on LA](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/more/01/18/lance.armstrong/index.html?eref=sihp), and of course, he's not amused.

Great to sneak out there today before the weather blew in. It was certainly cooler than it has been, but even so, spring is right around the corner. Can you believe it?
