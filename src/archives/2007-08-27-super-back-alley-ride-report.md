If you're ever feeling tired and rather unmotivated, you should give Super-Back-Alley a try.

Super-Back-Alley was not a planned ride, mind you; it was more of a series of navigational mistakes that added a mere mile or two to the already epic [Back Alley](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pjFl_x68koK1QxpaVPC16g?feat=directlink).

Don't believe me?! You should have a look at the Google Earth overview produced by Mr. Burton's little GPS watch. It clearly shows the ride was orchestrated by the troubled mind of a madman.

I can't count how many times the phrase [Steve Rule](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2007/03/05/linden-loop-ride-report) was whispered behind my back by Greg and Matt. Hey, honest mistake, boys.
