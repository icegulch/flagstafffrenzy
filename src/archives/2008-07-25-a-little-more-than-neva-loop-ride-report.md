Wow! Big ride today. Great group too! Turns out Dave flunked his InDesign course last week and had to take a remedial course this week. Slacker!

Anyhow, Julian joined Rob and me on a little Lefthand Canyon excursion. Hearing about Dennis's new bike and seeing Julian's definitely makes me want to get a new ride. I like the Cannondale and would still use it as a winter bike, but a nice new light ride would be swell.

Anyhow, thanks for riding today, guys! Have a good weekend.
