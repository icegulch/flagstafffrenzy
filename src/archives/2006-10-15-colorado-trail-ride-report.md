Last MTB ride of the year near Breckenridge

A hardy group of Frenz headed for the high country this past weekend in the hope of squeezing in that one last high ride of the season. Though the coat of snow we encountered driving through the Eisenhower Tunnel made us a little weary at first, we ended up having a great ride. We've assembled a nice [gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/ColoradoTrailRide) to share our fun with those otherwise obligated this weekend. We're sorry we missed you!
