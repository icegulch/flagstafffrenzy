Due to potentially annoying NW winds, we scrapped our Old Stage Road plans in favor of a more protected, though possibly tougher, trajectory: Sunshine Canyon Drive. The winds at the mouth of the canyon were vaguely vexing, but as we hit the steeper pitches, it was nice and calm, with only the flutter of our over-taxed tickers stirring the air. Great views of the still very snowy Divide today! Let's hope for pleasant weather tomorrow.
