This is what people seem to think of my ideas

Wasn't such a dumb idea to go out today! Sunshine Canyon was largely dry, except for one or two spots in the hollow at the bottom of the canyon. Otherwise, smooth sailingâ€”almost like summer.

Still, attendance continues to be down. Given [the number of lurkers on this site](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/analytics.gif), we should be seeing more folks! According to Google Analytics, there are 379 visitors, 167 new ones! Where are you?!
