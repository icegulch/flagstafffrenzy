Dave asked that I bolster the Frenzy ranks with this footage from his talk yesterday

It's a bit cliché to say this, but it was picture-perfect this noonday; indeed, it seemed as though you would see cobalt brush strokes if you just peered behind the peaks—it was _that_ clear!

Joining me today were Dave and Noel, who is the only faculty member whose calls I answer at 12p.

Dave showed his usual grit. I'm tempted to give him my heart rate monitor and see if he can max-out it out. I don't think it reads 106%.

Noel showed no signs of a fitness layoff, chit-chatting about this-n-that as though he were sipping chai at Amante. What a brut!

Dave and I are out tomorrow. Would someone care to take _The Replacement_ out for a grueling time trial? He felt the last ride he came on was way below his caliber.
