title: Favorite Openings (No Opening Report)
author: Steve

I've always been partial to the opening paragraph of Jack London's _White Fang_. Your faves?

Dave and I were pinned down by enemy fire this afternoon. Not to fret, however. We've dug a trench and [begun testing secret weapons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhmnOpoGAPw).

If riding's not in your temporal budget, why not post a few of your favorite passages? A few others I'm fond of:

*   [In Cold Blood](http://books.google.com/books?id=mYC3yRvvXxMC&lpg=PP1&dq=%22in%20cold%20blood%22&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q=&f=false) _by_ Truman Capote
*   [The Shock of Teapots](http://books.google.com/books?id=goVB8U5ruwoC&lpg=PA68&dq=cynthia%20ozick%20shock%20of%20teapots&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q=cynthia%20ozick%20shock%20of%20teapots&f=false) _by_ Cynthia Ozick

Maybe next it'll be favorite opening scenes of movies....
