      "body": "Sounds as if OTS is giving young Burton pause. I know from experience that these things can be difficult. In my old scout troop we often found ourselves pining away for the simpler civilian life. Though my knuckles ached from weaving lanyards and assembling dioramas of the first Thanksgiving, I had to suck it up and endure... no whining for this Cubby! And Mrs. Nagle, our den mother, was the queen of all &quot;time-jackers.&quot; She herded us through a brutal, unending world of flag-folding, bowline-knot-tying, popsicle-stick-fort-building hell. &quot;Much yelling&quot; indeed; my poor ears bled from her screechy rants. Hang in there, Matt! I know what it's like."
