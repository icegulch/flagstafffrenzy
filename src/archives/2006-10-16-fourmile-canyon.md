Pretty quiet out there today, except for the cement truck that followed me down from Salina. I did manage to make it to where the pavement turns to dirt, and I remembered how much I like that little town. If you haven't been up there, it's worth the extra 5-10 minutes of suffering...feels like an alpine village in the Old Country.

We'll see if the weather dictates duathlon or ride tomorrow.
