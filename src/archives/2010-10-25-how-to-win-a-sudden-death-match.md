Wow! I don't like golf, but I can appreciate this.

Gusty ride up Flag just now. My fingers are still a tad on the numb side. We could see snow blowing in over Sugarloaf and Gold Hill, and it had to be 10Â° cooler atop Flagstaff.

In a few days, the Amphitheater Road will be closed and the tippy-top will be ours again until May 1st.
