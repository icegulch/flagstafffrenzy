Yay! Ryan Van Duzer applied for that [dream job](http://www.islandreefjob.com/) off the Great Barrier Reef. He's perfect! Go, Duzer-Cruzer!!

Today was a first: I didn't see Dave try to chase anyone ahead of us. He showed real restraint, which is a good thing since he had surgery only hours ago. I think our little boy is becoming a man! I'm so proud.
