Air Canada allows you to choose the movies you watch **and** has an "Avant Garde" category!

If you have a chance to watch [Exit through the Gift Shop](http://banksyfilm.com/) featuring Banksy and Shepard Fairey, don't let it pass you by. Asks interesting questions about authenticity and art but ultimately leaves you wondering if Banksy's pulling a fast one on you.

Speaking of hucksters, how do you think Dave managed to spill Mountain Dew in the Frenzy's WordPress template engine? What a mess! Does anyone know if nail polish remover is safe to use on your `functions.php` file? Anyone curious as to why I have nail polish remover close-at-hand?

On an entirely unrelated note, I was pleasantly surprised that the _Chronicle of Higher Education_ ran [an article about bikes](http://chronicle.com/blogPost/5-Analog-Tools-I-Cant-Live/26858/?sid=wc&utm_source=wc&utm_medium=en) in today's "Professor Hacker" blog. Okay, well, it's more about low-tech tools, but apparently Professor Hacker is a cyclist. Groovy.
