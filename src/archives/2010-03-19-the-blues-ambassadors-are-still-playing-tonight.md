Dave accepted a ride home from Kentucky just to get back in time for tonight's gig

Just talked to Dave, and he was leaving DIA driving home. He says the show's still on, so ski on down!

He also said he was less worried about his flight departing than the banjo music playing "Distill My Beating Heart" at the airport.
