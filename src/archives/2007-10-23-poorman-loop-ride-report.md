Would that we all were fortunate enough to have trunk monkeys!

The Frenz improvised their route today, switching from Fourmile Canyon to Poorman Loopâ€”an excellent choice in hindsight!

Poorman Road must have been recently graded or packed down by the moisture from last weekend's snowfall. Regardless of the "how", it was well-packed and fast.

Dave, Trunk Monkey (Greg's nickname), was on fire, making Greg nervous and tense all the way until the last incline, where he caught Dave looking over his left shoulder and passed him on the right.

In the post-ride interview, Trunk Monkey was rather curt, saying he was not only baffled by Greg's tactics but also by the new sobriquet Greg had chosen for him.
