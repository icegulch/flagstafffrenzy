These kinds of temperatures are good training for when it gets _REALLY_ cold

Rode solo today. Don't know if it was the strenuous in-costume riding yesterday or the cold temps out there, but something kept the rest of you away....

Definitely a nippy 36° out there, especially coming downhill! I guess I've qualified for the 40° club in the new poll...though I'm quite sure I can go colder. Indeed, though I look like a boy scout on a weekend outing while riding in the cold, I don't mind carrying lots of gear up for the descent. It's amazing what a dry shirt, hat, and windproof coat will do! The rest of the week promises warmer temps, so hope to see you guys out there!
