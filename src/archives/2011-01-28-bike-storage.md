Superfund Cleanup Plan for Steve's Office (courtesy of Noah)

That's right: the cavernous viper pit in the basement of Humanities—the office formerly known as Steve's—will not go to waste, although it cannot be inhabited by humans again until 2091.

At least it can store bikes.

As promised, I'm [posting a photo](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/102_1095.jpg) from Adriana's recent Storm Peak research trip. Everything went swimmingly, according to unidentified sources.

Thanks for the prank voicemail today, Mark and Julian.
