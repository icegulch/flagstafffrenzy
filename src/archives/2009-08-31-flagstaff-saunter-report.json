Curious in Telecom_ Dear Curious, I didn't make it up, but the ReMax guy in the blue Pinto did, evidently. When we drove down to scope out our urban Shangri-La, it was Gone Johnson. No such place. As much as I'd love to subsidize Detroit's leprous economy, I'd really appreciate getting my $125 back. I just heard about a sweet deal in Centralia, PA. No me today - sorry Steve-O. Back on wheels tomorrow, though! DU"
