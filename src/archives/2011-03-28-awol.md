And you guys bought the "I'm working hard" song! (courtesy of Mom)

Phew, life in the fast line is tiring. There's the company ski day, keeping the kegerator topped off, and of course biking to work.

Seriously, sorry I've been AWOL of late. This week, I've blocked out time and am even looking at a morning ride or two!

So, how about Fox/Hound? I'm pitching this Friday, April Fool's. No joke. Hope you won't chicken out.
