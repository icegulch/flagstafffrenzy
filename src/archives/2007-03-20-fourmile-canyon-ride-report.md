Dave and Matt braved Fourmile Canyon by themselves this afternoon.

Mr. U battled tire problems (and mental ones too), while Mr. Burton wondered whether he would pay for biking at lunch and after work.

###### After Work Fox/Hound Ride Report

Fantastic game tonight! Kevin missed his co-hounds and took off on his own, managing to catch the foxes in half an hour. The foxes cornered this sole hound and forced him to turncoat.

With three foxes against a mere two hounds, the hounds had their work cut out for them. But, to their credit, they rode the challenging course and nearly caught us. Good show!
