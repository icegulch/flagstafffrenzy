Soon it will be too hot for Dave and me to ride, and we'll be forced to retreat to more polar climes

I have my Friday 12-2p gig today, so join Dave. He said today's ride is a "surprise," so show up at Telecom at 12:15p to see what he has in store. I may try to sneak out at 2:10p to get in my fifth Flagstaff ride in a row. You only live once.

Savor these cool temps, as it's going to be too hot to ride next week (72Â°F on Monday). All Frenzy activities will cease.
