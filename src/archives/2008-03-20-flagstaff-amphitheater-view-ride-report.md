Well, the conditions are certainly more spring-like these days. The only trace of winter was the slush-ice atop the Amphitheater Road and the blustery conditions.

Dave and Zack are supposedly skiing Cameron Pass today. Hope it's not windy up there, but somehow I think it will be. Greg had a 1pm meeting. Rob was getting his knee worked on.

So, I had the whole amphitheater to myself! Reminded me of my wedding dayâ€”without the monkey suits and minus the alone part, of course.
