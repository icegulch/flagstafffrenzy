      "body": "I heard the dreaded &quot;bink&quot; sound, followed by a nasty wheel wobble as we headed back in on Baseline. Bummer. And, as always, the broken spoke is on the fat side of my rear wheel, which adds a fair amount of overhead to the repair... gotta' yank the freewheel, etc.. At least the spoke failed at the _end_ of the ride. Boxing Boulder with a Fanny Fox shimmy would've been a real drag. Great ride otherwise. Thanks for breaking wind, Steve, so to speak."
