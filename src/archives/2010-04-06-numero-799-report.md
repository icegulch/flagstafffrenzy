Always tough to lose the home opener; fortunately, the Sox didn't. Damn Yankees!

Dave racked up his 799th Flagstaff ascent today. We only added one [crossed out stick figures](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2004/10/24/extreme-lunch-brake) to his log book.

First day in a while on the Amphitheater Road, though. Just delightful, the more so since no one else was there!

###### From the Morning

The Spring Classics are underway, and Paris-Roubaix is upon us. I may have the [Vuelta ciclista al PaÃ­s Vasco](http://www.universalsports.com/news/article/newsid=464433.html) as background noise in my office today. Yay for streaming video!
