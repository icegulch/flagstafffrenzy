This is for Greg. I'm excited to bike in London next week, but not this kind of riding!

Very nice conditions out there. Cloudy, slightly cool, humid, and an occasional breeze. It looks like it may rain again sometime today; let's hope it does!

I was surprised to wake up to thunder last nightâ€”thought our refrigerator was running loud or something at first.

I was also impressed with the volume of rain, which I later learned while biking to work was hail too. Indeed, all along the bike path in front of NOAA were piles of hail.

So, lurkers, it's no longer too cold out. Where are you?
