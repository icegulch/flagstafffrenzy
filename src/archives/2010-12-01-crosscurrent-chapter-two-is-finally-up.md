Ueli Steck is the Swiss speed climber who did the Eiger Northface in 2h27m

I'm sorry for not posting the next installment of Crosscurrent sooner. I've sent all of your complaint letters to Brigadier-chef Honor√© de Balzac of the _Office of Complaints and Hunting Licenses_. You might hear from him sometime before his retirement in 2053.

Meantime, enjoy [Chapter Two](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/12/01/crosscurrent-chapter-two). Chapter One can be [found here](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/11/14/crosscurrent-chapter-one).

It was more or less shorts weather today. I made the mistake of wearing my nordic ski pants, which were far too hot. Northwest Passage was nearly gravel-free, allowing for out-of-the-saddle climbing.
