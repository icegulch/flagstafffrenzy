Don't forget to come out for _The Blues Ambassadors_ on Friday at the Boulder Outlook

There was nary a chill in the air this afternoon as Dave and I set sail from the port of TCOM. The thin, gauzy clouds dissipated as we tacked uphill, allowing the sun to splash on our sloops.

Anyhow, after exchanging stories about all the strident, self-righteous jerks that, like prairie dogs, pop out of the ground from time to time in Boulder, we just enjoyed the sound of our tires passing over the sand.

A great respite! Thanks, Dave.
