      "body": "I do feel like an old man here at OTS. (The average age is pretty close to mine, actually.) The main reason for feeling so old and tired is the lack of rest. Each morning when we wake up at 0455 and form up for PT we think to ourselves, &quot;Self, I get to go back to be again in only 18 hours. Yay!&quot; Then we realized that we work a 40-hour week in two-and-a-quarter days. I'm not complaining; instead I am yearning for the old days of PT when it meant throwing on some bike stuff and heading up Flagstaff. I hope to put on my trail shoes and running once or twice with you fine folks over the Christmas holiday. Take it easy on an officer trainee, would you?"
