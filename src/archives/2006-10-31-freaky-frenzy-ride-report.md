It didn't take much to turn us from Average Joes into freaks ([gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/FirstFreakyFrenzy))

In spite of the conspicuous absence of many who seemed to have voted in the poll, the Freaky Frenz celebrated Halloween in style today. We all jammed to _The Meters_ on the way up, then froze our butts off on the way down. It wasn't that bad really. Thanks to everyone who showed up: Adriana "The Construction Zone", Dave "The Scotsman", Rob "The Devil", Matt "Jared from Subway", Greg "The Mormon on a Mission", and Jason as himself. Should we roast a turkey (or tofurky) for Thanksgiving?
