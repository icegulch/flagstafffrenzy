      "body": "You guys missed a good one today; both the ride and the entertainment. I gave a clinic in asphalt worship on the way back... Somehow as I was &quot;sprinting&quot; up one of those little rollers on 4th Street, my foot came unclipped (a slight twist as I pedalled?) and I dove head first of the bike. I went down HARD at something like 15 mph. Ouch. Lot's of road rash and a tweaked back. At least the bike is okay and I didn't land on the camera... Other than the dabacle on 4th though, it was an outstanding ride. Upper Bow Mtn. is tecnnical but do-able. You're gonna' love it."
