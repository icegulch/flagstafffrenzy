Every year Old Man Winter makes us forget there are rides other than Flagstaff. Today, we gave the old codger a kick in the pants by riding out east.

Despite our "outreach" efforts to swing by the CC, the forces of evil (meetings) conspired against our computing comrades. Dang!

Still, Dave and I spun around Boulder, shaking the rust off and stopping here and there for not-so-discreet nature breaks.

We may have to offer a [crevasse rescue course](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaweXnjx1CY) in view of some of the bottomless potholes Old Man Winter's left us.

Don't forget to change your clocks this weekend! And be sure to save next Friday's date for [The Immortal Blues Ambassadors gig](http://www.thebluesambassadors.com/) just across the way at the Boulder Outlook.
