Matt and Linda and I tried to lose him, more for the sake of keeping up a &quot;professional&quot; image than anything else. But the harder we worked the more it became apparent we were stuck with him. It was like a bad dream. The Curse of the Velcro Cruiser. Nightmare on Folsom Street. In fact, I think he might be behind me at this very moment! Aaaarghh!!"
