      "body": "To all wondering about the Mt. Evans Ascent: Well, I finished, and i didn't come in too late. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't pretty either. I felt a little sad as DU's 2:41 record passed while I was gasping for air at mile 12, but I persevered. When you think that the guy who won finished nearly an hour-and-a-half before me.... well... I need to train harder for Pikes! But thanks for all the support I got from you guys... You're the best!"

      "body": "Hey Roberto, Just remember... that guy who finished 1.5 hours up on you is from another species. He (Matt Carpenter) doesn't breathe the same air we breathe, and he sure as hell doesn't know what gravity is. Some day the podcraft will come and fetch him, then we'll _all_ be happier. You did great!"

      "body": "Since you asked, Steve... Jennifer and I were going to do our usual Kohler Mesa thing today, but it was w-a-a-a-y too hot. Stuck to the creek and the shade and it was nice. My idea. J was good-to-go for the climb, but I think I would've keeled over. Can't wait for cooler weather. Only two more months(!)."
