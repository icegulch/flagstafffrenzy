At least riding a mountain bike on Flag one can savor the joy of burying those road cyclists that you catch on the climb. Yeah I know its all about the ego....never lonely on my rides!"

I always assume that everyone around me is on an &quot;easy&quot; day; keeps the ego out of it. Because ultimately, you never know...and we're all gonna get old and die. On that note, I didn't get out today! Rats!!!"
