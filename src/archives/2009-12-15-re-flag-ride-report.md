Adriana's [first webpage](http://catfish.colorado.edu/~adrianar/) for Atmospheric Science 5600; I'm very proud

Wow, the pack ice caking the streets that feed Chautauqua is melting fast, especially on 16th, 14th, and 9th. This is good news for Cryo-Frenz.

Today temps were such that a jersey and vest were sufficient to keep warm on the ascent. On the descent, you basically just needed to zip up (and perhaps throw on a hat, if you're a real creature of comfort like me).

Pretty sure I saw [Tom Danielson](http://tomdanielson.com/) on his way down today. I was hoping he was doing laps so I'd get to watch him fly up, but apparently he was intimidated by my baggy tights and overall amateurish appearance.
