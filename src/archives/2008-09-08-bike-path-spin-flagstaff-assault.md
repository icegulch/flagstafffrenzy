Dave and I must have crossed our wires today. I missed chaperoning him to Flatirons Hospital. Let's wish him well, as he finds out if it is indeed a ruptured disk.

Shortly after you wish him well, it's okay to make fun of him. So here goes.

The reason I missed him was that he gave me the usual Monday morning phone call that runs something like this:

**DU**: Rush had some really salient points this morning...  
**SB**: \[Puts down phone. Gets up to make coffee. 5 minutes pass.\]  
**DU**: ...Anyway, that's what G. Gordon Liddy thinks. You there?  
**SB**: Thanks, Dave. Gotta run.

Somewhere in that exchange, I missed that Dave might be running late and we should postpone until a few minutes after 12pm. Oh well.

Good day out there just the same. Saw a deer and [redd foxx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redd_Foxx)...oops, I mean a red fox. Today was the first day I got to wear my Smartwool beanie too. Needed it!

I walked out of my office, having just looked at the [webcam](http://www.colorado.edu/webcam/) (since I don't have any windows down in HQ). Darn thing was stuck on an image from yesterday—I missed the **Important Notice** warning!

Imagine my surprise when the promised sunny skies turned out to be fog and drizzle. The temp at the [Mesa Lab](http://tinyurl.com/yj2ffw) was 44°F, which when combined with wet conditions means soup weather.

I'm just now getting the feeling back in my shins. Shouldn't have done the shorts today!
