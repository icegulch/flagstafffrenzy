Perhaps he's been a watchin' a bit too much o' the Black Pearl, and her mutinous crew on his Pirates of the Caribbean DVD. :-) Rumor has it he was seen out cavortin' lst night in Tortuga at a pub hoistin' a tankard of ale and cursin' Captain Barbossa. Maybe that ale put him in a bit of a fog this mornin'."
