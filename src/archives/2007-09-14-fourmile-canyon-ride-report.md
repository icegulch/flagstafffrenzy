Yeah, it's Friday!

Once again, perfect conditions for riding this lovely Friday afternoon.

Matt joined me for the Fourmile Canyon foray, which featured a slight upslope wind that lifted us up the ascent but didn't thrash on us during the descent. Quite nice.

Dave bailed on us today, deciding to go jam down at Robb's Music instead. Hope he leaves some feeling in those strumming fingers, as he may need those digits for braking on the descent tomorrow!
