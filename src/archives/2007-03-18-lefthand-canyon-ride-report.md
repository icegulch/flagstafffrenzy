The Frenz in Ward, CO, pleased there is a general store with cookies

A great turnout today (Sunday!) with seven folks in all: Greg, Kevin, Matt, Adriana, Dave, and highly touted rookie, Kacey. In spite of my deplorable tardiness, everyone managed to enjoy the ride, as well as the descent! Thanks for coming.
