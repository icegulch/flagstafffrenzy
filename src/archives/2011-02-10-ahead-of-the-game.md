Kinda ticked Jobs "borrowed heavily" from HQ plans again

Everyone knows Frenzy HQ is on the bleeding edge. That's why it rankles us to no end when our architectural designs show up on the interwebs.

At least they didn't find the trapeze plans.

Fun kayaking off Siesta Key this past week, though it didn't help when shoveling yesterday. Today's massage will do me good.
