      "body": "Hey Frenz, No boxing for me today... Boulder or otherwise. I've discovered that my bike has been shimmying like Fannie Fox (The Tidal Basin Bombshell; remember?) because the sidewalls of my rear tire have rotted through and the inner tube is herniating through the gaps. Makes for an amusing shape and a bumpy ride. I'm scared to take it over, say, 15 mph in its current state. So I'm going to nurse the old beater over to the Sanitas trailhead and run the South Ridge today. I'll try to hit Performance tonight and grab a new tire. Have fun boxing. If any of you want to pull a mutiny and join me, I'll cruise by Humanities at 12:05 - ish."

Oh well. Enjoy the spin around the flats. Dave, I'll see you at Humanities, and follow you to Sanitas for a quick hills workout. RL"
