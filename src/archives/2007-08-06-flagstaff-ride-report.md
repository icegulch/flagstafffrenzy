Dave, I may have figured out what's wrong with you

Though I didn't get in much of a ride (was turned around at the 'S' curves by construction), Dave did manage to make it up.

The road surface is as smooth as glass and will be conducive to fast times come fall. It will also make descending less nerve-wracking, as all those pesky potholes have disappeared.

Kudos to Brian and Rob for running the trails! It was a great day for it, what with the clouds and cooler temps!
