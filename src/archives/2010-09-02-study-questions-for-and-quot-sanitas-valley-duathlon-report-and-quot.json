      "body": "Hey, Professor. My roommate thinks you're hot (4.35 even)! Anyhow, I tried to log in to CULearn to see my grades for this course, and there were only smiley faces or frowns next to each assignment. Are you from the 60s? Here's my homework. 1) Absolutely not. Hygiene is _very_ important to me. 2) I tracked down Steve's parents on Facebook. They said they haven't heard from their &quot;no good&quot; son in years and could &quot;care less.&quot; 3) Cauliflower. 4) Where's the drawing tool in CULearn? When are your office hours? My friend Ann would like some intensive help. Did Tim really jack her car? Anyhow, I'm sending her to your home address, which I found on both Facebook and the men's room wall."
