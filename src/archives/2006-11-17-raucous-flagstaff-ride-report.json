Even more poignantly, she approached him as he was doffing his shirt, in spite of his modest attempt to disrobe in peace (near Euclid Parking Garage). It should further be noted that Burton started talking smack about those who are next on his &quot;drop&quot; list: Rob, Steve, Greg, Kevin. I believe I overheard him say something about another list of &quot;easy drops&quot;, which only included Dennis. Notice served."

      "body": "Holy Cow... Where to start. First, let's do some math. MB weighs in at a scant 25 years, DU at just under 55. This conquest - if you can call it that - is then akin to DU smacking an 84-year-old in a Frenzy event. DU is confident he could do that, _if_ he ate and slept well the night before and if his tires were well aired (so to speak). He might also want a wee bit of a handicap. As to canoodling, DU defers to MB. MB admittedly canoodles at a world-class level, and DU is awed. would like to remind MB that one goes into battle with the body one has, not the body one might want or wish to have at a later time. must go now; his Depends are binding."
