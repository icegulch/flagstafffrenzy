Slim pickins out there today too. At least Kevin made it. Mr. Burton text-messaged us from DIA, where he's stuck at the terminal, to express his regrets for not making it. Was chillier than the JeffCo Airport led me to believe—maybe 42°. Rob has put in a request for a run tomorrow, so I may end up posting his requested route and a bike ride route too. Extra credit for those who do both!
