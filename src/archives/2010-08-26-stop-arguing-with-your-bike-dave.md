A bike chain with a business card...and a name? (courtesy of Julian)

Julian went searching for a new chain yesterday, and he was surprised by the celebrity status of one of them:

> So I was told that my 7900 chain had worn out by the mechanic at my bicycle boutique (A Mamil could hardly shop anywhere else!)
> 
> Jodie asked if I wanted him to put on a new chain, to which I responded "Is there an upgraded option?"
> 
> "Yeah but that's more money" He said. The difference in response from a mechanic to a salesperson. "Give me the good stuff" I said.
> 
> It's not often a chain comes with it's own business card! I think I'll call it Cheryl.

Now there's a credo we should all live by: "Gimme the good stuff." I've mobilized that expression before with mixed results, like when I tried to rob Dave at water-gun-point. Failed miserably.

As a major news outlet, the Frenzy is responsible for reporting on the news as it happens, fair and balanced. Sadly, sometimes we're obligated to report on our own. Case in point, iSean just filed this in the _Police Blotter_:

> Martin County Sheriff's deputies spied David Underwood, 37 (purportedly), around 4 a.m. Tuesday 'yelling at his bicycle' in the parking lot of a Mobil gas station in the 3900 block of South Kanner Highway. 'Customers were coming to the Mobil and were very disturbed as to the yelling and obscene argument the defendant was having with his bicycle,' the affidavit states.

I know that must have been a tough one to cover, iSean. Thanks for the solid journalistic piece.
