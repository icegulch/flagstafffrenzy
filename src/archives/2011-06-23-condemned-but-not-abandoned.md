All this blog needs is a fresh coat of paint

Who can blame Dennis for thinking the Frenzy had been abandoned? I mean, the odors went away, the plants grew back, and cheer returned to the world.

Well, world, we've got news for you. Just like Voldemort, poor taste and disestablishmentarianism are back! Okay, I suppose the smell's back too.

There is one exception, though. No sign of Dear Dave. Last I saw him was at Target purchasing an "office cot", whatever that is.

Any leads?
