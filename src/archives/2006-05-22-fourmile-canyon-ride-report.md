Transfixed by Dave Underwood's impossible climbing cadence, we three pursuers neglected to watch the pavement below us, and poor Dave Fuller had an unfortunate encounter with a small stone with a mean edge. Fourmile foiled Fuller, Notheis, and I, but Underwood, Burton, and Raudzens forged onward to conquer the storied canyon walls. Burton is looking stronger everydayâ€”rumor has it he's been practicing on weekends too! Raudzens is a daring descender on her electric blue Townie. And Underwood is...well...Underwood "The Badger"!! Until tomorrow!
