      "body": "Rob and I watched SB blow past NW Passage in warp drive. He had his mind set on Linden Loop, but since we were in the 'hood, we decided to sample a clockwise NW Passage - a first. Yikes. The road was dry and choppy and we had to tip-toe all the way down. No spills, though, and we both agreed climbing stuff like that is much easier than descending. Hope you had a good tour of the alpenburbs, Steve! DU"
