title: Reunited and It Feels So Good Report

Most of the non-permanent cobwebs have cleared from my head, so it was nice to saddle up and get out in this increasingly pleasant weather.

Rob and Dave joined the party in Fourmile Canyon. We're anxiously awaiting Rob's GPS report, which will tell us if the ride up the canyon consists of 1000 feet of elevation gain.

I think it does, if you go to Salina; but Crisman might be just under. We'll have to revisit all our rides to see if they pass the 1000 foot benchmark.

Weather's supposed to improve, so I'm starting to think: Northwest Passage, Back Alley, and Old Stage. Hope you can make it!
