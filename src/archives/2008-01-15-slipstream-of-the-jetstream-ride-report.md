Mark suggested I get this tee. Hey, at least Dave reads my blog!

It was quite windy out there, even on Flagstaff. Still, nothing like oxygen rammed down your lungs to ensure you breathe regularly.

A few patches of ice and lots of sand on the road, but nothing too bad. I suspect we'll be running the rest of this week, given the forecast. It was nice to get out and ride, though.
