Well, that didn't take long

In case you wondered how long after SB's departure it would be before I ruined the Frenzy, wonder no more. By the time Steve gets back from Florida, I will have doubtless turned his _magnum opus_ into something you'd feel compelled to hide under the floorboards. Sorry, Steve, but no one _forced_ you to go sit on Mickey's lap again (isn't this something like the seventh time?). Looks like a great day to hit Sunshine Canyon. Buzz me if you're feeling over-dry; 2-2672. DU
