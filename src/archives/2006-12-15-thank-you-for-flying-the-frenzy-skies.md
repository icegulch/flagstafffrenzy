Thanks to the westerly winds, it's dry out there!

Great fun today with Dave, Greg, and Matt. We fought the cuckoo-inducing Chinooks valiantly. At least on Flagstaff, the wind is at your back in one direction of the hairpin turns!

My throat is utterly parched from our favorite little zephyr, though. I drank an entire bottle of water to no avail. Maybe I'll tote bottled oxygen next time.

If we do get some snow this weekend, get ready for duathlons next weekâ€”perhaps even "True Initiation".
