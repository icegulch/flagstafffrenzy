After a week of searing heat, we hit Flagstaff one more time today for a half-hearted duel, which was less a competition than a test of mettle. Let's face it, it was DANG hot out there! Anyhow, thanks to Matt, Kevin, and Dave for participating. We'll do it again sometime soon, when temps are more agreeable. Don't days like today make you wish it were snowing?! See you all next week.
