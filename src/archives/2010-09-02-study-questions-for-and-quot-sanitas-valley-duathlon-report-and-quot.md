Ask your teacher to wake up and explain this nonense

1\. In ["Sanitas Valley Duathlon Report"](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2007/12/17/sanitas-valley-duathlon-report) Steve claims to have muddy clothes. Do you think he is telling the truth? Why? Would you return to _your_ office with muddy clothes? Why not? 2. What does Steve mean by "a touch beyond?" Do you consider this normal? Why not? Should someone tell Steve's parents? 3. Steve claims to be "back on speaking terms" with Dave. Do you think Dave knows this? Do you have friends like Steve? Why not? 4. Draw a picture of what you think Sanitas Valley would look like. Be sure to include details from the story. Is that dog poop in the bottom right corner? Ugh! DU
