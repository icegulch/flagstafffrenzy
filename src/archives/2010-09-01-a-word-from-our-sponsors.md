Look, folks! It's our first sponsor. I'm glad we decided against AdWords.

The Frenzy's about to undergo a major facelift in the coming week: Dave's taking the wheel. Yesterday, he informed me he already has four posts written and "they're good."

This is bad news for me.

Looking forward to being lampooned! Until I return, have a great Labor Day. Get out and enjoy this lovely riding weather!
