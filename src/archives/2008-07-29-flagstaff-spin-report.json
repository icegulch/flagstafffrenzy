      "body": "Nice getting my bike back in order and on the road again today, though I felt a bit like the crew on the first flight after the Challenger crash; I kept my eyes firmly glued to the big red EJECT button all the way down. Any time I do my own mechanical work, especially on mission-critical stuff like wheels and brakes, I naively renew my faith in soft landings. The creek was lovely, thanks. I raced a golden retriever for a tennis ball bobbing up against the opposite bank, but the pup was quick for a dog paddler, let me tell ya.' I just hate it when they gloat. Jeez, I would've given him the ball anyway."
