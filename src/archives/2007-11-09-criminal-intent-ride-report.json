      "body": "That guy who fell in w/ us was claiming to be &quot;out for a little loop up to Estes.&quot; I was really glad to hear him retire the plan after adding in the vertical on Criminal Intent. Took a bit wind out of his sails. Of course I was ready for an IV and a 4-way bypass by the time we turned onto Wildcat Drive. What's a little angina and a minor stroke, though, when you get to see someone else flirting w/ The Bonk? Misery might love company, but it absolute adores south-bound hubris."
