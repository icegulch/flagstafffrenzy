      "body": "Happy B-Day Adriana! Sorry you couldn't celebrate today by helping us straighten out 4-Mile a bit. Also, Burton: it's the same old same old.... chase him down, rest up for a sec or two, chase him down again. Sort of like walking a Rottweiler on a 40 ft bungee. Truth be told, I'm glad he's back and that the surgeons stayed well clear of his ego. I had feared he'd come back to us like a post-EST Jack Nicholson in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.&quot; &quot;Mmmm, Juicy Fruit.&quot; Good to see DM out w/ us today also. Hope it portends more."
