      "body": "A broadside of lower-cortex signals from the ATLAS towers... First of all, yes, I AM Debra Jackson. What of it? We all have hobbies, no? Steve does short-wave from his basement, hoping to find someone - _anyone_ - out there who wants to hear about his recent trip to New Hampshire. Fine. I like to &quot;fancy up&quot; a bit and browse the unmentionables at the Dollar Palace. So sue me. By the way, SB will be holding forth tonight at 413.2 Mhz, if anyone wants to hear the part about the dead moose on the I-90 overpass... again. Also, I'm thinking now that iSean has joined ranks w/ the Adopt-a-Highway crew, we may be mistaken for a work unit from the Boulder County jail. We really need to print up shirts specifically stating that we're volunteers, not felons. For the most part, I mean. And about today... I'm coaching Berly again. We have 8-count burpees and jumping jacks on today's menu. Speedwork starts next week. DU"
