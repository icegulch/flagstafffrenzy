Apparently, global climate change is helping the Frenz in one respect

[Avast](http://talklikeapirate.com/howto.html#basic)! The Arctic's icy grip on the paved channels and fj√∂rds around Boulder loosened enough for us to set sail for the [Northwest Passage](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/routes#northwest).

Dave, Matt, Adriana, and I braved the turbulent waters and made the loop in near record time. We even managed to avoid being boarded by some deer who jumped in front of us twice on the descent of Linden Drive. Phew!

As usual, Matt has furnished us with [our vital stats](http://trail.motionbased.com/trail/activity/4000595) from the ride.
