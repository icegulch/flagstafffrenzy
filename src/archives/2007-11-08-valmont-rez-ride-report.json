      "body": "Hope I can make the ride tomorrow. After reading today's Frenzy regarding cycling fatalities, I suspect I'll be up late tonight fitting the Wheeler w/ air bags. If I get get the whole mess operational, I should be golden for tomorrow's descent into the legal underworld. Speaking of risk and response, what about those brain stems who want to pack weapons on campus (the ones who staged the &quot;empty holster&quot; protest Monday)? &quot;They don't call him 'Shorty' for nuthin', ma'am, and that big ol' Colt just sorta' makes him feel better.&quot; (I'll tell you a great story about that over handlebars sometime.) Sheesh."
