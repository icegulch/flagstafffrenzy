      "body": "I rode in on my good bike this morning in anticipation of actually going for a ride today. However, a noon meeting popped up out of nowhere, so I'll be sitting in a conference room while you're all out enjoying the blue skies and 50 degree temps. In lieu of sympathy cards or gifts, I ask that you please make donations to my favorite charity, The Human Fund, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJvbZZWt9g4. -Kevin"
