Metaphor for Frenzy rides of late

Finally remembered to get some beer at work last Friday. Sunshine wheat. Very tasty, but not recommended if you intend on doing more work.

This week is Rally's "Snow Day" at Eldora and in true Frenzy style, I'm going to try to ride up via Magnolia, then ski. We'll see how that goes. I may opt to cash in on my drink vouchers straight away.

Meantime, hope we can "string together" a single ride this week.
