Nothing says "I love you" like heart-shaped meat

Good to see Dave and Rob today, although Dave's immediate flat seemed suspicious. I think I saw him later, reclining on the quad with a smoothie.

Yesterday was a great day. Adriana and I hit the ModMarket after work, then we saw "True Grit." Great night out!
