![pure hell](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/tropics.jpg) Excuse me, but can you direct us to the elevators down to the Entertainment Deck?

We had nigh-on a perfect visit to the Virgin Islands. One rotten little incident, though, dug it's claws into our otherwise flawless vacation: As we gybed across Drake Passage under Tortola's lee, Bonnie, the First Mate on the all-wood schooner _Heron_, slipped on a bit of wet teak and knocked over Kacey's rum punch. She (Kacey) had just been delighting the crew with her new-found talent of lighting burps (this rum was _very_ high proof). Also, I think it may have permanently stained my new Patagonia shorts.

Took us a day or so to shake the funk.

Other than that, things went pretty damn well.

Anxious to see you guys

###### Steve Gets Bumped

  
Wonder if Underwood will bump me from my slot when he gets back

Leno's back. Unfortunately, I didn't get out for a ride.
