title: Initiation Duathlon Flagstaff Ride

Today, I reached the base of Flagstaff and 1) noticed the muddy trails, 2) didn't have a bike lock, and 3) saw no one, so I decided to bag [Initiation](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/initiation_view.jpg).

Instead, I rode Flagstaff on the truck (my mountain bike turned commuter bike). The nice thing was I could put all my cold weather descending gear in the bed of the truck (the milk crate on my bike rack).

It was a day Dave would've loved (he's in Cortez). And though I didn't ride with my shirt off, I was down to just a short-sleeve, so he would've been proud.

No school tomorrow, so enjoy the long weekend! I'm headed to some hot springs and to the [Great Sand Dunes National Park](http://www.nps.gov/grsa/) for some fun and training on the sandy steeps of the dunes. Ciao!
