It's never too late to try to be happier

Once again, [congratulations to Rob and Maria](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/2010/12/05/the-newest-of-the-frenz)! We're very happy for you and hope you're safely ensconced in your home.

Doesn't look like the snow in Northern New England will affect tonight's Pats/Jets game. Damn! I did see that UNH advanced to the quarterfinals in the Division I Football finals, and that UNH Hockey is ranked 5th currently (and beat Vermont 5-1 yesterday).

Unfortunately, the Flagstaff Frenzy still ranks last in inconsequential matters such as good taste, hygiene, and basic human decency.
