Dave was joined by his friends today as he slogged up his favorite hill for the 700th time. It was great having the cooler full of drinks and goodies right there under the flagpole, and the professional photographer was an especially nice touch (gallery coming soon!). Everyone loved their commemorative T-shirts. In spite of a few notable no-shows and a P.A. system that cut out right in the middle of "Stairway to Heaven," it was a picture perfect afternoon. Congratulations to Dave and Frenz on another successful 100,000+ vertical feet! Oh... and April Fool, Bailey!
