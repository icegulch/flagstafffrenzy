###### Reminder: Paula's Big Day!

Frenz, join us tomorrow morning at 8am sharp at the junction of the Bear Creek Path and Martin Drive ([map](http://www.google.com/maps?q=Martin+Dr,+Boulder,+CO,+USA&ie=UTF8&ll=39.992049,-105.246019&spn=0.015486,0.040169&z=15&om=1&layer=c&cbll=39.98818,-105.253886)). We're going to accompany Paula Vaughan on her run from [Boulder to Michigan](http://pjsrun.blogspot.com/)...I plan on stopping at the Computing Center, though. Don't be shy about donning your favorite tee-shirt eitherâ€”yes, that's your Frenzy tee!

  
_Touching the Void_ should be the Frenzy slogan

Rob and I joined forces and rode [Fourmile Canyon](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/routes#fourmile) today, though Rob bravely carried on up Poorman while I headed to a ill-timed meeting. Thanks for coming along, Rob!

I saw Dave heading over to his completely safe run route of Poorman Hill (on his bike). Quit fooling yourself, Dave-O! You're not fooling us.
