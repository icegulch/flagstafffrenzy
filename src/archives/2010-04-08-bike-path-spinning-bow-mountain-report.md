I think I know the cause of my back pain. Had a little fall this weekend.

At first Dave and I were thinking flat spin, but in view of the chilly temps, we decided to climb and stay warm. Bow Mountain provided the right venue.

Indeed, we haven't been on its sandy switchbacks for some time. Though we didn't ride the "Roubaix" section, we did break a sweat on the tarmac.

On the way back, we waxed philosophical as is our custom. Great custom!
