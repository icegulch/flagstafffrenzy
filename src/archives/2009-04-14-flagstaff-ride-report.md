They took the Mythbusters video down already, so here's a good clip from "The Office"

Dave and I had fun on Flag this afternoon. Though the sky looked drab and cold, it was deceptively warm on the slopes.

On the descent, we were able to sit in the draft of two motorcycles, which was great for picking good lines. I had the added treat of meeting Adriana at the base of Baseline to get some bagels for lunch.
