If you haven't seen this German film about the Eiger, put it in your queue

Who wouldn't take advice from the kinder, gentler "Uncle" Dave? He's cuddly. I'd go out and have a hot toddy with him anytime. Heck, I'd even vote for the chap.

For those of you used to visiting the Frenzy with older browsers (IE8-, Firefox3.0-, Stone Tablet 1.0), HQ's tweaking the design to accommodate you. Initially the intent was to push the limits of HTML5/CSS3, but we understand the appeal of things like black and white tv, horse-drawn carts, and cave paintings. You're soooo retro!

Until those tweaks are made, you might consider surfing the web with a modern browser such as [Chrome](www.google.com/chrome), [Firefox 3.5+](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/firefox.html), [Safari 5](http://www.apple.com/safari/download/), [Opera 10](http://www.opera.com/browser/download/), or even the beta version of [IE9](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/download/ie-9/worldwide). We won't think any less of you.
