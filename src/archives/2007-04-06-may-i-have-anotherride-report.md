Freezing drizzle and freezing fog make Steve's hands red and tingly. Ouch! That was the most painful ride ever. Yes, I said ride!

I rode my commuter bike up to the Gregory Canyon Trailhead, locked up, and hit the trail with the goal of running [Initiation](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/initiation_view.jpg). After about 100 steps on the trail, I bagged that plan.

Every rock, root, and waterbar was covered with a veneer of treacherous ice. And I worked on [Mount Washington](http://www.mountwashington.org), so I know deadly glazing when I see it.

I did an about-face, remounted the commuter bike, and pointed my front tire at Flagstaff, where the road still hadn't glazed over. Everything else—trees, gutters, grass—had, though.

Riding up (made the gate) I wore a polypro sleeveless tank and my neon rain slick. On the way down, I shed the tank and put on my fleece hat, fleece pullover, down vest, and rain slick. If I had a pair of mittens with rain protection, I would've been fine.

But, dummy that I am, I brought gloves, which insta-froze on the descent. Fortunately, I survived but only barely. Harshest weather yet for me....

I saw a pro on a road bike heading up on my way down. He had no descending gear, so I hope he turned around at Panorama Point!

We'll be watching _Höllentour_ in Humanities tonight. Lemme know if you're interested. Otherwise, stay warm and safe this weekend!
