We rode in a clockwise direction today

Big pack of riders today: Matt, Rob, Kevin, Adriana, and I. If there weren't stop lights everywhere, we would've done a great job staying together too. Nice to do some flat noodling.

Apparently, Mr. K-No has thrown in the towel as concerns Flagstaff. He saw [The Hole](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/zwQa0q9JdiVzPPyZQUbUYQ?feat=directlink) up close, and thinks it's crazy to ride up such slopes. Hopefully, Kevin will convince him otherwise. Perhaps we could do Sunshine instead.

###### Flagstaff Construction

Looks like we won't be doing Flag for a while (from _BikePed eNews_):

> Flagstaff Road Overlay, **Flagstaff House to the Amphitheater parking lot**. Starting this Thursday, August 2, Flagstaff Road is going to be very slow and unpleasant, for both cyclists and motorists. Cyclists should expect rough pavement, heavy equipment, and construction activities along the entire stretch of road on weekdays from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Single-lane restrictions will occur most of the day during construction with total road closures of 20 to 25 minutes at a time. We expect construction activity to start at the Amphitheater and work its way downhill as the project continues. Construction is expected to be completed by Friday, August 10. No construction activities or associated delays are expected over the weekend.

Dave, what are you going to do now?
