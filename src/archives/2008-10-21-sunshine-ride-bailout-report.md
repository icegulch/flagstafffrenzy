Dave couldn't make it; Rob's on his honeymoon; and others are tied up. Given this and the impending cold front, I thought it best to wait until I get home to run with my dogs. Tomorrow might be a good day for a duathlon or duel.

Dave says it snowed on the 13th, which means two folks were winners in this year's [first snowfall poll](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/pollsarchive#polls-2-ans). Congrats!

In other random news, why don't baseball relief pitchers have to make a quick transition into the game? I think those switches should be more like hockey substitutions...no darn warm-up pitches! Just run out there (don't walk!) and throw.
