A little ditty for Ricardo Ricco. Catchy tune... Hopefully CSC hasn't been [singing along](http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/other_sports/general/view.bg?articleid=1108274&srvc=othersports&position=2)

Still darn hot and dry. But, today, there's hope that thunderheads will actually deliver. Fingers crossed.

Dave had to be back early, so we stuck close to home and enjoyed our favorite ride. Dave hit the creek after, as per usual. Stay cool, all!
