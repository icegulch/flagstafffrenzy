Indeed, I bailed on the planned Northwest Passage ride. My dear wife was the only one who joined today, and she requested that we hold off on NWP.

So, Flagstaff it was. Great ride, though there was the scent of burning foliage in the air, which later proved to be a fire over near Baseline Rez (hopefully a planned burn).

Chillier than I had thought it would be, but not bad for the descent. The sun made it bearable.
