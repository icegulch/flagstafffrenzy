title: Since There's No Winter Here...

In view of my carpentry skills, I'd last about a week in the bush.

Although December is living up to its windy reputation, it's hard to believe we're nearing the solstice. While Steamboat had 90" of snow in November, we've only had about 1.5".

For some reason, I've been reading about Alaskan climbing adventures and watching Dick Proenneke carve his wooden masterpieces once again. I think I really need a snowstorm.

Have a great weekend, everyone!
