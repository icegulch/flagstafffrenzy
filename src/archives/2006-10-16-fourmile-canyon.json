My legs acted as if they'd never been there before... Like, &quot;Hey we don't do stuff like this! We're tired! We want to go home!&quot; That kind of nonsense. I had to remind them that the three of us (me, left, right) used to make a regular diet of climbs like Sanitas, but they just acted stupid and surly. We all left in a bad mood."
