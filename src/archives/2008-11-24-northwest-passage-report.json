      "body": "Funny how two and two sometimes dance around in dumb, jerky circles before finally merging to make four. At the top of The Great Wall of Mud today, we stopped for a moment to adjust our stuff for the descent. SB donned about twelve layers of Gortex, Kevlar, Tyvek, Poly-Pro, and rock wool. I rolled my sleeves down. As he slipped a powder blue Patagonia NoseCozey over his head, he told me he'd washed all of his riding clothes this weekend. &quot;That's nice,&quot; I said, thinking he did, in fact, smell less exhumed than normal. Or at least not as _recently_ exhumed. I didn't give it any more thought. But just now, while I was watching the construction guys chase each other around the new art building with power tools and water balloons (Move-in date December 2009? Not at this rate!), I remembered a little news item I'd seen in the Daily Camera this morning. It seems several workers at the Boulder County sewage-treatment plant were airlifted out of the facility late last night, due to &quot;severe respiratory distress.&quot; A spokesman said a sudden surge in &quot;biotoxins and germs the size of plump gerbils&quot; had overwhelmed the plant's ability to keep up. Those workers who weren't physically sickened were nonetheless sent home and scheduled to begin intensive counseling as early as this morning. Residents were asked to flush judiciously until the system returned to normal... hopefully by month's end. See what I mean? Four. DU"
