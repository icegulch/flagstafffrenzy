If you're not up between [12:40a and 2a](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20026147-17.html), here's what you'll miss

I've been wondering why I've been howling at the moon and getting hairy of late. Now it all makes sense.

This is a grand week to be on campus. No kiddies. No skateboards. And an added bonus for this time of year: no snow.

Of course, I like the snow and miss the days of throwing a nerf football into snowbanks for Matt Burton to dive into.

Have fun stargazing this evening!
