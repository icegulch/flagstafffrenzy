Werner, our boss, is rumored to be participating in this one. A source close to Mark has suggested that those who leave the boss behind will "regret the day they were born." Again, that rumor is unconfirmed. What is confirmed is the time we'll meet: Friday, 3/4 at 1:10pm at the Flagstaff Trail lower trailhead.

See you there!
