Turns out Dave was at Murphy's for lunch, then returned to work with grave consequences

Despite the winds and the fact that it's November, Frenzy numbers were strong today. We had four and a half warm bodiesâ€”Dave and I count as 0.75ea, if you're wondering!

Though we were ambitious in planning for Super-Flag, I think everyone was content to settle for the traffic-less ramps of the Amphitheater Road. I know I was anyhow.

Thanks to Bret, Sean, Greg, and Dave for joining me on this very warm November afternoon. I think the temperature was 68F at the Mesa Lab, in fact.
