Saw Mr. Danielson on my Sunshine ride today (I do wear my helmet!)...the Pyrenees are awesome!

It was good to noodle down University with Dave and Boulder Berly during the first part of the ride.

At 6th and Arapahoe, we parted ways, with those turkeys going up Fourmile and this turkey going up Sunshine. But they should've followed me for a minute longer....

At the junction of 6th and Canyon, I got to see [Tom Danielson](http://www.tomdanielson.com) waiting for the light on the other side of the road. He was with some other Garmin support guy Scott Owens of [Colorado Premier Training](http://www.coloradopremiertraining.com/), who was on a scooter.

Anyhow, the climb up Sunshine was great: Colorado dry with 76Â°F temps, which is ideal for this time of year.

After climbing Sunshine, I dropped down to Fourmile via Poorman and spotted the turkey vulture duo nearing the Poorman junction, so of course I attacked to beat them to Crisman.

Turns out, the joke was on me, for they must have turned around there. I rode up to Crisman, then back to Poorman and up over to Sunshine again in the hope of bugging them. No such luck.

Hope y'all had fun!
