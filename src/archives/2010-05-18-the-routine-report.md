I wonder if this is how I hurt my back.

Back in business today (pun intended). My doc cleared me to ride, so Dave, Kevin, and I headed up Flag for a pleasantly paced ride.

It's threatening to rain, but it held off during our sojourn. My friend Scott is out in Lamar storm-chasing todayâ€”he's an NCAR weather nerd. You can see him on [this map](http://www.spotternetwork.org/google.php) (2:11p MST). Be careful, Scott!
