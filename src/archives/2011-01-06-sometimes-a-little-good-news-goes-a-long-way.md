Hurray! The video from yesterday had 350K hits when I saw it, then 6M hours later!

Though there are far too many folks out there without a roof over their head or food on the table, this story does offer a little cheer and perhaps charitable inspiration.

It'll be fun to see Captain Burton this weekend. He's swooping down on us after a number of sorties in desiccated lands. He's turned in the bike for [these wheels](http://www.aviationearth.com/Images/C-17_4.jpg).

Hope you're enjoying this last week of clean restrooms and quiet walkways on campus!
