The Steve Rule helps Frenz determine the grade of steep slopes

Kevin, Matt, and I noodled up and around in just about an hour exactly, so this will have to become more of a regular objective.

In a light discussion of the finer points of Chaos Theory, Matt and Kevin discovered a new mathematic formula, called the Steve Rule, which they think will help Frenz determine hill gradients more accurately. Great work, guys!
