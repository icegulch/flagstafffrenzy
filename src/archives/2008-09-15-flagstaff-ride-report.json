And if she prevails in November, look for other adventures in streamlining: _Washington, April 22, 2009 (AP) Just days after John McCain's accidental choking death in a White House mop closet, newly-minted President Sarah Palin has announced sweeping changes to the federal government. The Departments of Energy, State, Defense, and Justice have been merged into one new office, The Department of Public Works. &quot;It worked really well in Wasilla,&quot; said the former Miss Mukluk as she signed the executive order directing the massive changes. &quot;You could get anything you needed by simply dialing one number. We even mailed out those little magnetic do-hickeys you can put on your fridge!&quot; Palin has pegged political unknown Cole Bledsoe to head the new organization. Bledsoe, who hails from Moosepellet Alaska and has a PhD. in Hillbilly Science from Bob Jones University, spoke with the press about the challenges of filling leadership roles in the new mega-agency, saying &quot;It's hard enough finding one decent horseman in Alaska, not to mention four.&quot; President Palin, who will be hunting and camping somewhere on the White House grounds over the weekend, has scheduled a press conference for Monday morning in the executive skinning room._ Gad.
