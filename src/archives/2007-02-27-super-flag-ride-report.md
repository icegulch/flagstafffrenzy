Not everyone climbs on two wheels

With snow in the forecast, we deemed Super-Flag mandatory today. What a perfect one too, with temps around 41°F and a beaming sun!

Dave ran into some dérailleur troubles near the top, leading us both to conclude that it's high time we clean our bikes. Perhaps we should do a Frenzy bike wash on the quad.

Ran into a favorite author of mine today at the height of land (atop Super-Flag). Very cool!

I used to teach his work at [New Hampshire](http://www.unh.edu/) and [Pitt](http://www.pitt.edu), and when not parsing Derrida's sentences for my own comprehension, I used to devour his books and short stories. Nice guy who can climb on the bike too!

As an armchair mountaineer, I feel obligated to remind you guys that tonight and tomorrow night the [Banff Mountain Film Festival Tour](http://www.banffcentre.ca/mountainculture/festivals/2006/film/awards/default.asp) is showing at the [Boulder Theater](http://www.bouldertheater.com/). Some of the award winners this year are really inspiring, and some are just plain scenic! Get out to catch a showing if you can.
