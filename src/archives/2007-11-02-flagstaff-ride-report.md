I can't feel my fingers.

This is only the second time I've been under-dressed, but it's not as bad as the other time when it was raining at 35°F, soaking my gloves and hands. Ouch!

Still, the weather was primo today, affording splendid views of the Eastern Plains and campus. Dave and I love these mid-fall days—clear and crisp.

Dave heads west this evening for a fishing and camping trip. Bring lots of soup for those nights under the stars! Hot springs nearby?
