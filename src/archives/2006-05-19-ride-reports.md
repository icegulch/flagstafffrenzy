Phew! What a week of riding!! We went out everyday this week, which is a sign that spring has sprung. On Thursday we were joined by Noel Lenski, Chair of Classics, for a classic butt-kicking spin up Old Stage Road that would've left Zeus in the dust. Ouch! The next day, Friday, we felt the sting of our hubris in our quads, struggling to keep the pedals ticking over on Sunshine Canyon's 14% slopes. The clouds were welcome, as were the views of the Indian Peaks.

Next week's agenda will be posted soon, so stay tuned. I'm looking at fox/hound again on Monday, then possibly Fourmile Canyon on Tuesday, and maybe Super-Flag on Wednesday. Let me know if you have preferences. Otherwise, bon weekend, mes amis!!
