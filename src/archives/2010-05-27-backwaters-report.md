Some call them backwaters. Dave and I call them home.

Rather than ride _Back Alley_ in reverse, we chose instead to ride _Northwest Passage_ against the grain. Can't say I'd recommended it, especially when they've recently graveled. But, hey, this is the Frenzy.

Thanks for the company, Dave. Don't forget: twelve shades of khaki and knave doormenâ€”a recipe for boredom!
