title: Misty Vale Moving Violation Finally!

Some vignettes from our outing today. Greg [captured some of the fire damage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gcEQcadL80) too.

Today's ride has been a gleam in our eye for many moons, so it was good to [finally bag it](http://picasaweb.google.com/flagstafffrenzy/MistyValeMovingViolation). Compared to some of our other GoogleMaps-inspired adventures, this one was quite rideable.

I'd like to revisit [Misty Vale Moving Violation](http://www.flagstafffrenzy.org/routes#mistyvale) sometime in the spring. It's a little much for a road bike, unless you don't mind hiking some. But, I'll bet you could cyclocross it.

For the rest of today, I won't feel bad about sitting on my butt watching football. Go Buffs!
