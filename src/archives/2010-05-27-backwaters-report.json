      "body": "There he goes again... _The twelve shades of khaki._ I hate it when SB starts up, especially halfway up NW Passage on a hot day. And this sermon was a doozy; all bile and sputum. When we hit the summit and I'd caught my breath, I reminded him that humor was history, that it was just so much twentieth-century jetsam, and that we were all better off without it. It was like showing the periodic table to a cat. Sometimes I don't know why I bother. The thing is, I have the same problem at home. The other night at dinner, the oldest cracked a joke as if it were the most natural thing in the world. I zinged an edamame bean off his forehead, and exclaimed &quot;_What the hell was that??!!_&quot; &quot;Jeez, Dad... I was just trying to be funny.&quot; &quot;_Funny??!!_ If it's _funny_ you want, go to one of those places downtown that smells like Lysol and where they don't make eye contact. But don't bring that _funny_ crap into this house, _do you understand me, mister?_&quot; &quot;Jeez, Dad, don't be so khaki. I was just making a joke.&quot; I couldn't believe I had to go through this again. The kid gets good grades, he seems sharp enough in general, but, like I said, he's a lot like Bailey - a heel digger. I started out slow: &quot;What does humor lead to?&quot; &quot;Disrespect?&quot; &quot;Right. And what does disrespect lead to?&quot; &quot;Onanism?&quot; &quot;Nope. You're two steps ahead of me. Disrespect leads to rebellion, remember?&quot; &quot;Oh yeah... and rebellion leads to social decay?&quot; &quot;Right...&quot; Et cetera... I'm sure he'll get it eventually. After all, it makes perfect sense, doesn't it? _Well?_ DU"
