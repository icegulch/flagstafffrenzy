There was light in the darkest recesses of _Back Alley_ today

Man, someone pinch me! It's summery out.

Dave and I managed to cajole Greg into joining us on what now merely qualifies as a semi-crazy ride, given the existence of _Patients of Job_, _Super-Sugarloaf_, et al.

It was actually refreshing to swoop down into the frost pockets at the base of Sunshine Canyon. The 10-15Â° temperature difference didn't chill us one bit.

Poor Greg, though: if you see him later today, ask him what he thinks of our "purge" method of recovering from a cold. Somehow, I sense that he's worse off, which means it was a good ride, of course.
