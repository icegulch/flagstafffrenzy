Steve's "truck" toppled by Boulder dirt.

Ahh, the joy of spinning uphill with gears galore. Sean broke in the new (and stunning, may I add) bike with a celebratory Flagstaff ascent. But who knew what multiple cogs could do for you on the downhill! Steve and I had barely clipped in to begin our descent, when we realized Sean was no longer in sight. We discovered our favorite iFriend coolly passing the time at the bottom of the hill, sending off a few text messages while waiting for the slowpoke Baileys to arrive.

Dave - how was your flat (yawn) ride out East?
