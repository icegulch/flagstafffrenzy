Flew solo today. Dave had a lunch date.

It's cooling off out there, and I was glad I had my down jacket tucked into the crate of "the truck" for the descent. Lots of "serious" riders on the hill today. Overheard "...ordered wheels from New Jersey" and I knew it was not my crowd.

My sister is driving here from L.A. starting tonight. Let's collectively wish her safe passage. Our maternal grandmother used to leave a lit candle in the bathtub whenever one of us would travel anywhere. Wonder if it's against fire code to do that in the HUMN bathroom?

Seriously, be safe, Kate! You need to be ready to ride at 6,000 feet.
