title: Flagstaff Ride (Really!) Report

Thanks to Rob, I was able to get out on the roadbike today and enjoy the now much drier tarmac on Flagstaff Road.

While there are still a few sneaky, slush-ice sections, they can be avoided. At least our weather's not as bad as [what my hometown is experiencing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2008_Northeast_ice_storm) now!

Have a great weekend, all!
