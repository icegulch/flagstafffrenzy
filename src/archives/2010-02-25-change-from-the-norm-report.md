Sheesh! I thought my garage was small.

Dave and I were reminded that winds can be stiff and cold on today's jaunt. Fortunately, for the extra effort they demand, they reward with clean, refreshing air!

We spun over to Boulder Reservoir in the teeth of the wind, watching in awe as banks of snow swallowed the Flatirons.

On the ride back, we enjoyed the tailwind and chewed the fat while gracefully swerving around man-eating potholesâ€”it's been a rough year for our beloved roads.
