It was breezy along Fourmile Creek today. Matt, Adriana, and I found ourselves grabbing for the water bottles every two to three seconds to keep our mouths fresh.

Poor Adriana: she was all excited about how her Geography Graduate Orientation was going and wanted to share it with us, but we kept the pace at about 95% her max heart rate, cruel bastards we are. Some husband, eh?!
