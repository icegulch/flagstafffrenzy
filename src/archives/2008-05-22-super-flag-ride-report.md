It was a Steve Bailey kind of day up there today... Raining, gusty, thunder hammering away just over the ridge. We missed you bro! K-No and I held the Frenzy mantle high, though, and rode a very cool Super Flag, K-No arriving at the overlook oh, say, about 12 hours ahead of me. I hadn't been up Super since winter, and I noticed the county engineers have somehow made it steeper. Helps with the runoff, I guess.

> Cooler temps call for steeper grades, don't you think? To seal the deal, K-No has requested something hilly, so let's do a Super ride today. We can decide which when we meet at Humanities at noon.
