Matt has modified his bike to accommodate his growing muscles

This weather is fantastic! There were a total of six Frenz on the roads around Valmont Rez...almost seven, but Kevin had a flat.

Thanks to Dave, Rob, Matt, Adriana, and Marc for riding! Marc is one of Adriana's colleagues from [CIRES](http://cires.colorado.edu/) who enjoys cycling, trash talk, and filling out financial travel forms.

Dennis: Dave said he saw you running (he emphasized _running_, so you must have impressed him) around campus at lunch. What gives? All that pounding on the knees is bad for you...
