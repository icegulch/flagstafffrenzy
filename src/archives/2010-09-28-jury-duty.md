It took me 1:33h to run this road when I was 18; this guy drove it in 6:21min

Dr. Werner informed me that Dave had jury duty today, but I pointed out to him that most jurors don't have to wear orange jumpsuits. It seemed to have slipped Mark's notice.

Mark would make a good juror for the defense.
