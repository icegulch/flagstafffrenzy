My only time on two wheels will be the ride from Humanities to the CC via the Boulder Creek path. Rob, I'm sorry to report that your testimony in favor of $230 italian-leather-clad mountain bike shoes was not quite enough to get me to plunk down the cash. Instead I will spend $20 for some new inserts for my current Diadora pair."
