Like Steve Martin's character in the movie [Roxanne](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093886/), I knew something was wrong with the air as soon as I stepped outside this morning. And, as it so happens, my nose [didn't deceive me](http://tinyurl.com/6rrdra) .

Just now, Noel sent me this note from the Emergency Manager at Environmental Health and Safety:

> \[T\]he smoke may cause minor lung and/or eye irritation, and may be a nuisance for individuals with existing medical conditions such as asthma. To minimize the effects of the smoke, keep windows and doors shut and **remain indoors when possible**.

Ignoring common sense and basic health practices, Dave, Noel, and I strode up Flagstaff like a couple of cocksure peacocks ([consonance](http://rhetoric.byu.edu/figures/C/consonance.htm)).

My throat was really dry the whole way, so I took several pulls off my water bottle. But, Dave says that this is a character-building day ("It's actually good for you," he opined); of course, Dave isn't known for his sense of self-preservation....or his good character.

Dave's bike broke down once more, so Rob has found him a [manly new one](http://www.craigslist.org/about/best/sfo/765370039.html) on Craigslist.
