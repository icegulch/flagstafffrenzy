      "body": "East I spun, Through malls and parks of dull industrial commerce. My spokes like quicksilver did charm the bustling hoard, As I, clad all in spandex, lycra, chrome, and steel, Did attack pavement, concrete, and the innocent pebbl'd cob. For I was the Armstrong of the Creek Trail, The Meteor of the Sidewalk, nursing my sanguine wounds In stealthy pursuit of dilute and crippled endorphins On backstreets, in alleys, and through nursing home parking lots. No longer shall the misty heights of Dear Flagstaff, Poorman, and Sunshine Feel the bruising crease of my elderly rims, For I am a slackard, a flat-lander, and a wuss. O Time, thou hast robb'd me of my youth! (Had to take a short lunch today... went spinning out east. Sheesh.)"
