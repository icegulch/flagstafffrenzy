Dave's cool band...that's him on the bass

Flagstaff is just peachy now that it's repaved. Thanks to Rob, Dave, and Matt for noodling up with me.

Matt's requested a flat ride tomorrow, so make sure your crankset shifters are working (eh-hem, Dave).

###### Warning

Next time we play fox/hound, Eric Sherrill suggests we be careful:

> **Running club members face felony charges** By Cara Rubinsky  
> Associated Press Writer NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- Two people who sprinkled flour in a parking lot to mark a trail for their offbeat running club inadvertently caused a bioterrorism scare and now face a felony charge. \[[full story](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1Y1-109759468.html)\]

Thanks for the heads-up, Eric!
