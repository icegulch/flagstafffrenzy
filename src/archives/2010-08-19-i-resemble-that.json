      "body": "Mamils? This has happened to me before: I realize that the avocation/hobby/sport I deeply love has been discovered/adopted by Bob, the fatuous wretch who lives down the street. Cycling, which I got into thirty years ago? It's Bob's favorite now, and, as he stretches in his driveway, shameless in God's sight, after a long (six mile) ride, he lectures me on &quot;fast-twitch training drills,&quot; and &quot;feathering the gears on The Morgul.&quot; Back-country skiing? Bob's been there, done that; _The bowls below Notchtop were a little cruddy this season, didn't you think?_ Flyfishing? Ditto. I've thrown Bob off, though. Rather than pursue a restraining order against his next half-assed intrigue (&quot;Sorry, but no Stratocaster for you, Mr. Smith. We have a directive from the court...), I've tossed him a red herring: &quot;What's in the box, Dave? Looks heavy.&quot; &quot;Oh nothing, Bob. Just the latest cool thing. I can't wait to get started using it.&quot; &quot;Well, what the hell is it?&quot; &quot;Nothing, really Bob. _Men's Health_ says it will revolutionize masculine _chic_ in America, but, really, it's nothing. Excuse me, but I have to get it down to the basement where it'll stay cool.&quot; &quot;Really?! Where can I get one? Does it come in carbon fiber? Are there accessories? _What the hell is it?!_&quot; Really, it's _nothing_. ;) DU"
